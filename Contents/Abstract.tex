With the increasing awareness of the problem of fossil energy consumption and environmental pollution, solar energy is regarded as the best potential alternative of fossil energy. This research is based on the national cooperation project ``Collaborative research on key technologies to produce electricity by cascade utilization solar thermal energy''. The objective of this project is to conduct research on the equipment of solar thermal power generation system, to propose, develop and optimize a solar thermal cascade system depending on the advantages and disadvantages of the solar thermal power generation technologies, and to explore a new feasible technology for large-scale solar thermal power generation. The main contents and conclusions of this thesis are as follows:

Multiple novel topological structures with cascade collection and cascade utilization of the cascade systems were proposed. In these systems, different types of collectors were used for cascade collection and different types of thermodynamic cycles were used for cascade utilization. After the investigation of each technical proposal of cascade system, representative typical cascade solar thermal power system topologies were selected.

Mechanism models were established for the components of solar thermal power generation system by using mathematical calculation tool and system development tool. The modeling process uses an object-oriented approach to ensure each component has both independence and relevance. The system model has the advantages of convenient organization, clear structure, easy improvement. For component modeling, the Stirling machine modeling process, considering various irreversibilities and losses, established a more accurate Stirling mechanism model with verification analysis. The results show that the accuracy of the established Stirling model is higher than that of the classical Stirling engine models.

The effect of different arrangements of Stirling engines on the efficiency of the cascade system was studied. 
According to the working features of Stirling engine, five basic arrangements of Stirling engine array were proposed, and corresponding simulation models were established.
Performance differences of different arrangements of Stirling engine array were analyzed with different inlet fluid temperature, fluid heat capacity and Stirling engine numbers.
It was found that series connection is the best arrangement for the best robustness and maximum efficiency of the Stirling engines.

A multistage heating system was proposed, which can effectively reduce the exergy loss of steam generating system. During the entire heat exchange process of a conventional steam generating system, there is no phase change in the heating fluid and there is a phase change in the heated fluid. There exist large heat transfer temperature differences between the two fluids in the heat exchangers, which makes large entropy production during the heat exchange process. In this thesis, a method of heating in stages is proposed, in which the flow rates of the heating fluid in different heat exchangers are controlled to reduce the heat transfer temperature difference and the exergy losses, and effectively increase thermal efficiency of solar fields.

A performance evaluation method of solar cascade thermal power generation system was proposed. In this thesis, corresponding independent systems of the cascade system were chosen for comparison, and the system performance evaluation models were established. After simulation and result analysis of the systems, it can be found that the cascade system has a higher overall solar-to-electric conversion efficiency under certain parameters compared to its corresponding independent systems.

A solar thermal power generation test platform was established, and the relevant experimental work was carried out. By designing different experimental conditions, influences of solar direct normal irradiance, flow rate and inlet temperature of heat transfer fluid were investigated.
The experiment also validated the established trough collector and dish collector models.

%In this thesis, the idea of solar thermal cascade collection and cascade utilization was put forward. The mechanism research and modeling method of solar thermal system were studied. The Stirling engine array arrangement and steam generating system were optimized. The performance evaluation of cascade system was investigated. Construction work and experimental research of the solar thermal power generation test platform were carried out.

%With the increasing awareness of the problem of fossil energy consumption and environmental pollution, solar energy as a renewable energy, which has the advantages of widely distribution, huge amount, inexhaustible and no pollution, has received much attention by many countries and been regarded as the best potential candidate of fossil energy. Concentrating solar thermal power generation is another form of solar power generation technology except solar photovoltaic power generation. Compared to solar photovoltaic, solar thermal power is gaining more attention for its advantages as smooth power generation, good grid compatibility, easy to integrate with existing fossil power plant. However, solar thermal power is not yet widely applied due to the problems of current technologies.

%For this reason, this research is based on the national cooperation project "Collaborative research on key technologies to produce electricity by cascade utilization solar thermal energy" as the background. The objective of this project is to research the equipment of solar thermal power generation system, to propose, develop and optimize a solar thermal cascade system depending on the advantages and disadvantages of the solar thermal power generation technologies, and to explore a new feasible technology for large-scale solar thermal power generation. The main contents and conclusions of this thesis are as follows:

%Multiple topological structures with cascade collection and cascade utilization of the cascade systems were proposed. In these systems, different types of collectors were used for cascade collection and different types of thermodynamic cycles were used for cascade utilization. After system evaluation, parameter selection, preliminary calculation and scheme comparison, two representative typical schemes were determined. In one scheme, both Rankine cycle (water as the working fluid) and Stirling cycle are used for power generation. Cooling water of the Rankine cycle is used to cool the hot end of the Stirling engines to recover the released heat. In the other scheme, multiple organic Rankine cycles are used for power generation. Condensation heat of upper cycle is absorbed by lower cycle for energy cascade utilization.

%Mechanism models were established for the components of solar thermal power generation system by using EES and MATLAB. The modeling process uses an object-oriented approach, taking full advantage of inheritance, polymorphism and other characteristics, to ensure that each component has both independence and relevance. Among them, the Stirling machine modeling process, considering various irreversibilities and losses, established a more accurate Stirling mechanism model with verification analysis. The results show that the accuracy of the established Stirling model is higher than that of the classical classical Stirling engine models.

%The effect of different arrangements of Stirling engines on the efficiency of the cascade system was studied. Stirling engines can be connected in series, in parallel or in hybrid. The connection type affects the temperature and flow of the heating and cooling fluids of each engine, which in turn affects the power and efficiency of the Stirling machines, and the solar-to-electric efficiency of the cascade system. Through the analysis of different arrangements of Stirling engines, it was found that series connection is the best connection type for the best robustness and maximum efficiency of the Stirling engines, and the largest solar-to-electric efficiency of the cascade system.

%A method of multistage heating was proposed, which can effectively reduce the exergy loss of steam generating system. In conventional steam generation systems, the flows of heating fluid (typically oil) and heated fluid (typically water) through the preheater, evaporator and superheater do not change. In the entire heat exchange process, there is no phase change in the heating fluid, while there is a phase change in the heated fluid. There exist large heat transfer temperature differences between the two fluids in the heat exchangers, which makes large entropy production during the heat exchange process. In this paper, a method of heating in stages is proposed, in which the flow rates of the heating fluid in different heat exchangers are controlled to reduce the heat transfer temperature difference and the exergy losses. 

%A comparison method of cascade system and traditional solar thermal power generation systems is proposed. In this paper, corresponding independent systems of the cascade system was proposed for comparison. It is found that the cascade system has a higher overall solar-to-electric conversion efficiency under certain parameters compared to its corresponding independent systems. Under the condition of direct solar radiation intensity of 700\,$\mathrm{W/m^2}$ and dish collector outlet air temperature of 800$\mathrm{^\circ C}$, the solar thermal cascade power generation system of Scheme 1 is better than the corresponding The efficiency of stand-alone system is increased by 5.2\%. The solar thermal cascade power generation system selected in Scheme 2 is 15.3\% more efficient than the corresponding independent system.
