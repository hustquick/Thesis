随着化石能源消耗和环境污染问题的凸显，太阳能作为一种新能源，具有分布广泛、总量巨大、取之不竭、无污染的特点，越来越受到世界各国的重视，被广泛认为是未来最有潜力替代传统化石能源的清洁能源。在发电领域，太阳能光热发电是除了太阳能光伏发电之外的另一种发电形式。与光伏发电相比，光热发电因具有发电平稳，电网兼容性友好，易于与现有化石燃料电厂组合等优点而受到越来越多的关注。然而，太阳能光热发电大规模应用受限于现有各类技术的成本、效率等问题。

基于此，本文以国家国际合作项目专项“太阳能梯级集热发电系统关键技术合作研究”为背景，目标是研究太阳能光热发电装置，利用各种传统型式的太阳能光热发电系统的优缺点以及热力特性，提出并组建、优化太阳能梯级集热发电系统，为探索出大规模低成本高效率利用太阳能的光热发电技术提供新的方案。主要研究内容包括：

提出了多种采用梯级集热和梯级发电的太阳能光热梯级发电系统。在梯级系统中，采用了多种型式的集热器，实现能量的梯级收集，采用多种形式的热功循环，实现能量的梯级利用。经过系统评估、参数选取、初步计算、方案比较，确定了两种具有代表性的梯级系统方案。一种方案同时选用水工质朗肯循环和斯特林循环，利用给水来冷却斯特林机冷腔，回收利用斯特林机放出的热量；另一种方案选用多级有机工质朗肯循环，利用上一级的凝结热来加热下一级的循环工质，实现能量的梯级利用。

以EES、MATLAB等工具，建立了梯级系统中各部件的机理模型，进而组建了梯级系统。采用面向对象的方法，充分利用了继承、多态等特性，保证了各部件之间既具有独立性又具有关联性。其中，斯特林机的建模过程中，考虑了多种不可逆过程及多类损失，建立了较为完善的斯特林机机理模型，并进行了模型验证分析。结果表明，所建立的斯特林机模型的精度要高于传统的经典斯特林机模型。

研究了太阳能光热梯级发电系统中斯特林机组不同排布方式对系统效率的影响。斯特林机组可以采用串联、并联或串并混联的连接型式，连接型式会影响斯特林机的加热流体和冷却流体的温度和流量，进而影响斯特林机的功率和效率，影响整个梯级发电系统的光热发电效率。通过分析斯特林机组的各种不同的排布方式，发现串联连接是最佳的连接型式，斯特林机组具有最佳健壮性和最大的发电效率，梯级发电系统也具有最大的光热发电效率。

提出了分阶段加热的方法，有效降低了蒸汽发生系统中的㶲损。在传统蒸汽发生系统中，加热流体（通常为导热油）和被加热流体（通常为水）流经预热器、蒸发器和过热器中的流量不变。而在整个换热过程中，加热流体无相变，被加热流体有相变，两者存在较大的换热温差，换热过程有较大的㶲损。本文提出分阶段加热的方法，通过改变加热流体的流量，减小换热温差，降低换热过程的㶲损。

提出了太阳能光热梯级发电系统与传统型式太阳能光热发电系统的对比方法。本文针对新型梯级发电系统提出了其与传统型式太阳能光热发电独立系统的对比方法。梯级系统在一定的参数条件下，相比其对应的独立系统，具有更高的总体光电转换效率。在太阳直射强度为$700\,\mathrm{W/m^2}$，碟式集热器出口空气温度为$800\mathrm{^\circ C}$的条件下，方案1所选用的太阳能光热梯级集热发电系统比对应的独立系统效率提升$5.2\%$，方案2所选用的太阳能光热梯级集热发电系统比对应的独立系统效率提升$15.3\%$。

With the increasing awareness of the problem of fossil energy consumption and environmental pollution, solar energy as a renewable energy, which has the advantages of widely distribution, huge amount, inexhaustible and no pollution, has received much attention by many countries and been regarded as the best potential candidate of fossil energy. Concentrating solar thermal power generation is another form of solar power generation technology except solar photovoltaic power generation. Compared to solar photovoltaic, solar thermal power is gaining more attention for its advantages as smooth power generation, good grid compatibility, easy to integrate with existing fossil power plant. However, solar thermal power is not yet widely applied due to the problems of current technologies.

For this reason, this research is based on the national cooperation project "Collaborative research on key technologies to produce electricity by cascade utilization solar thermal energy" as the background. The objective of this project is to research the equipment of solar thermal power generation system, to propose, develop and optimize a solar thermal cascade system depending on the advantages and disadvantages of the solar thermal power generation technologies, and to explore a new feasible technology for large-scale solar thermal power generation. The main contents and conclusions of this thesis are as follows:

Multiple topological structures with cascade collection and cascade utilization of the cascade systems were proposed. In these systems, different types of collectors were used for cascade collection and different types of thermodynamic cycles were used for cascade utilization. After system evaluation, parameter selection, preliminary calculation and scheme comparison, two representative typical schemes were determined. In one scheme, both Rankine cycle (water as the working fluid) and Stirling cycle are used for power generation. Cooling water of the Rankine cycle is used to cool the hot end of the Stirling engines to recover the released heat. In the other scheme, multiple organic Rankine cycles are used for power generation. Condensation heat of upper cycle is absorbed by lower cycle for energy cascade utilization.

Mechanism models were established for the components of solar thermal power generation system by using EES and MATLAB. The modeling process uses an object-oriented approach, taking full advantage of inheritance, polymorphism and other characteristics, to ensure that each component has both independence and relevance. Among them, the Stirling machine modeling process, considering various irreversibilities and losses, established a more accurate Stirling mechanism model with verification analysis. The results show that the accuracy of the established Stirling model is higher than that of the classical classical Stirling engine models.

The effect of different arrangements of Stirling engines on the efficiency of the cascade system was studied. Stirling engines can be connected in series, in parallel or in hybrid. The connection type affects the temperature and flow of the heating and cooling fluids of each engine, which in turn affects the power and efficiency of the Stirling machines, and the solar-to-electric efficiency of the cascade system. Through the analysis of different arrangements of Stirling engines, it was found that series connection is the best connection type for the best robustness and maximum efficiency of the Stirling engines, and the largest solar-to-electric efficiency of the cascade system.

A method of multi-stage heating was proposed, which can effectively reduce the exergy loss of steam generating system. In conventional steam generation systems, the flows of heating fluid (typically oil) and heated fluid (typically water) through the preheater, evaporator and superheater do not change. In the entire heat exchange process, there is no phase change in the heating fluid, while there is a phase change in the heated fluid. There exist large heat transfer temperature differences between the two fluids in the heat exchangers, which makes large entropy production during the heat exchange process. In this paper, a method of heating in stages is proposed, in which the flow rates of the heating fluid in different heat exchangers are controlled to reduce the heat transfer temperature difference and the exergy losses. 

A comparison method of cascade system and traditional solar thermal power generation systems is proposed. In this paper, corresponding independent systems of the cascade system was proposed for comparison. It is found that the cascade system has a higher overall solar-to-electric conversion efficiency under certain parameters compared to its corresponding independent systems. Under the condition of direct solar radiation intensity of 700\,$\mathrm{W/m^2}$ and dish type collector outlet air temperature of 800$\mathrm{^\circ C}$, the solar thermal cascade power generation system of Scheme 1 is better than the corresponding The efficiency of stand-alone system is increased by 5.2\%. The solar thermal cascade power generation system selected in Scheme 2 is 15.3\% more efficient than the corresponding independent system.
