\chapter{Optimization of steam generating system}

In a traditional solar parabolic trough power plant, the potential of exergy loss reduction in the heating process of Rankine cycle is large. There exist large temperature differences between the heat transfer fluid (HTF) and water in the steam generator subsystem (SGSS). In order to reduce the temperature differences, this paper put forward a novel multi-stage exergy-loss reduction system (MERS) with different HTF flows to lower the required HTF temperature. A flow control strategy of HTF depending on the analytical system model was derived. Energy and exergy efficiency of the MERS was analyzed and compared with the SGSS of traditional solar parabolic trough power plant. Result shows that the MERS can effectively decrease the exergy loss in the heating process, thus the performance of the plant can be improved.
