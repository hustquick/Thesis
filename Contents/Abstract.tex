With the increasing awareness of problem of fossil energy consumption and environmental pollution, solar energy as a renewable energy, which has the advantages of widely distribution, huge amount, inexhaustible and no pollution, has received much attention by many countries and been regarded as the best potential candidate of the fossil energy. Concentrating solar thermal power generation is another form of power generation technology except solar photovoltaic power generation. Compared to solar photovoltaic, solar thermal power is gaining more attention for its advantages as smooth power generation, good grid compatibility, easy to integrate with existing fossil power plant.

Commercial solar thermal power generation technology is divided into trough collector power generation, dish collector power generation and solar tower power generation. These three types of power generation technologies have their own advantages and disadvantages: trough collector power generation is the most widely used one, its cost is low, however its efficiency is also low; dish collector power generation has high efficiency and smaller capacity, it is used for distributed generation widely; solar tower generation, which has large scales, high efficiency and high cost, is currently in rapid development stage. Based on the idea of ​​energy cascade collection and energy cascade utilization, this paper proposed a cascade system that uses different collector power generation methods and different thermodynamic cycles, which may be a new and feasible technology to realize large-scale solar thermal power generation.

The research is based on the national cooperation project "Collaborative research on key technologies to produce electricity by cascade utilization solar thermal energy" as the background. The objective of this project is to research the equipment of solar thermal power generation system, to propose, develop and optimize a solar thermal cascade system depending on the advantages and disadvantages of the solar thermal power generation system, and to explore a new feasible technology for large-scale solar thermal power generation. The main contents and conclusions of this paper are as follows:

Firstly, the topological structure of solar thermal cascade power generation system was proposed. According to the analysis of thermal characteristics and the working characteristics of each component in the system, rationally arranged topological structures of cascade system were proposed. These systems use different thermodynamic cycles to utilize energy in different temperature zones. A reasonable cascade generation system can make full use the performance characteristics of the components in the power generation system and provide the foundation for higher efficiency solar thermal cascade generation systems. In this paper, several schemes of feasible topological structures of solar thermal cascade system were set up according to the components in the system. After system evaluation, parameter selection, preliminary calculation and scheme comparison, two representative typical schemes were determined. In one scheme, both Rankine cycle (water as the working fluid) and Stirling cycle are used for power generation. Cooling water of the Rankine cycle is used to cool the hot end of the Stirling engines to recover the released heat. In the other scheme, multiple organic Rankine cycles are used for power generation. Condensation heat of upper cycle is absorbed by lower cycle for energy cascade utilization.


Secondly, mechanism models were established for the components of solar thermal power generation system. The mechanism mathematical models were developed according to the operation mechanism of the target object and physical equations. The key components in the system, such as collectors, steam generating system, steam turbine and Stirling engine, were modeled with details. The mathematical model of each component is a model verified by the classical theory or a large number of experimental data, which is the basic of the model of the cascade solar thermal power generation system. Heat loss models were established for the receivers of trough collector and dish collector. For the Stirling engine, based on the reasonable simplification and hypothesis, the model of the Stirling machine considered various losses and irrevisibilities was developed. The component models were developed in MATLAB by using object-oriented method. It makes full use of inheritance and polymorphism to ensure both the independence and the relevance of the components.

Thirdly, the solar thermal cascade generation system models were developed. Based on the selected solar thermal cascade generation systems, solar thermal cascade generation system models were established based on the model of each component in the systems. The object-oriented features of inheritance, combination and polymorphism were used for the model development. The change rules of the main parameters and the performance indexes under the coupling of external and internal factors were studied. The change mechanism was studied and the calculation method of its performance characteristics was established. After setting up the components, setting the parameters and compiling the environment, the paper completes the system construction of each system scheme, and finally completes the simulation system of solar thermal cascade generation based on MATLAB with the copyright of independent computer software. The system components are relatively independent, easy to replace or improve the parts model; the results of the calculation of the system model can be a single object to easily view the various components of the system key parameters.

Then, simulation and optimization of cascade solar thermal power generation system model. Based on the study of the performance characteristics of solar thermal cascade generation system, the system is optimized and the structure is reconstructed. In particular, by analyzing the steam generation system of the system, a method of staged heating is proposed to reduce the heat transfer temperature difference in the steam generating system by changing the mass flow rate of the heat conduction oil, effectively reducing the heat generated during the heat exchange process in the steam generating system. Which can improve the efficiency of the whole system. Based on Stirling unit in cascade system, five kinds of basic arrangement forms of Stirling unit are summarized, and the difference of unit efficiency and output power under various arrangement forms is analyzed, and a given cold and heat source fluid Stirling unit under the conditions of the best arrangement.

Finally, the operating parameters of solar thermal cascade power generation system are optimized. According to the specific structural scheme and operation mode, the performance parameters and economic indexes of the cascade generation system are taken as the objective function, reasonable adjustable parameters are selected, various constraints are established, and modern optimization methods such as genetic algorithm and ant colony algorithm are used to complete the system Parameter optimization analysis, as well as the independent system for comparative analysis. The results show that solar thermal cascade power generation system has higher overall photoelectric conversion efficiency under certain parameter conditions than its corresponding independent system. Under the condition of direct solar radiation intensity of 700\,$\mathrm{W/m^2}$ and dish type collector outlet air temperature of 800$\mathrm{^\circ C}$, the solar thermal cascade power generation system of Scheme 1 is better than the corresponding The efficiency of stand-alone system is increased by 5.2\%. The solar thermal cascade power generation system selected in Scheme 2 is 15.3\% more efficient than the corresponding independent system.
