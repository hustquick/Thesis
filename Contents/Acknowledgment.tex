The completion of the doctoral dissertation indicates that my student life here is coming to an end. Although I had discouraged days in the unforgivable life, when I staggering to leave the land that accomplished my grown up years, I am grateful for all the hardships and joys I have experienced.
The full harvest of both academic and life will change my life journey.

You miss a place because you miss the people there. Special thanks for professor Huang Shuhong, I learned a lot during those years being with you. I have been deeply infected by your academic attitude, working spirit and personal charisma. Your unique academic insight and acute academic ideas always inspired me.
