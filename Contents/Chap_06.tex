\chapter{Cascade system performance evaluation}
\section{System description}
In the cascade system, dish collectors are used to provide heat for Stirling engines and air-to-water heat exchanger. Trough collectors are used to provide heat for steam generating processes (preheating, evaporating and superheating) in the Rankine cycle. Figure~\ref{fig:System-1} shows the scheme sketch of the cascade system. In this system, hot air is produced by the dish collectors. High temperature (1073\,K) air is used to provide heat to Stirling cycle to get higher conversion efficiency, then the air is used to provide heat for air-to-water heat exchanger to use the lower temperature energy in Rankine cycle effectively. Besides, feed water of Rankine cycle is used to cool the Stirling engines to recycle the heat wasted conventionally. 
%Water is used as the working fluid of Rankine cycle, which is heated in the cold chamber of Stirling engines, preheater, evaporator, superheater, and air-to-water heat exchanger successively, and then expand in turbine, condense in condenser. Pumps are used to change the pressure of fluids. Stirling engines are used for power generation and cooled by feed water of the Rankine cycle.

State points of different fluids are marked on the sketch. The number indicates the type of the fluid, the letter indicates the state point of the fluid. State points with solid circle indicate saturated liquid states ($x = 0$\nomenclature{$x$}{Dryness fraction}), and with dotted circle indicates saturated gas states ($x = 1$). Figure~\ref{fig:T-s_Water2} shows the $T$-$s$ diagram of the water circuit in the cascade system. In this Rankine cycle, the heat provided in process $2e$-$2f$ comes from the Stirling engines, which increases the power of Rankine cycle. Figure~\ref{fig:HeatTransfer_Water-SEs} shows the heat transfer diagram of this process.

To build the cascade system model, several simplifying assumptions are made:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Steady state at nominal load of the system is analysed.
	\item Pressure drop due to flow is negligible.
	\item The leak of working fluid in the pipes is neglected.
	\item Same isentropic efficiency of steam turbine with different loads and in different stages.
	\item Heat loss that occurs from the tube to the atmosphere is not considered.
	\item There is no heat loss to the environment for Stirling engines.
	\item Simple models are used of some processes and equipment.
	\item A symmetrical regenerator behavior is assumed so that a single effectiveness can be defined as $e = (T_R - T_L) /(T_H - T_L)$.~\cite{Formosa2010, Juhasz2010}
	\item A linear temperature profile across the regenerator exists, the mean effective temperature $T_{R} = (T_H-T_L) / \ln(T_H/T_L)$.~\cite{Der2007, Cavazzuti2012}
\end{itemize}

Figure~\ref{fig:Stand-alone-systems} shows the sketch of the stand-alone systems. These two stand-alone systems were developed for comparison. They use the same dish collectors and trough collectors with the same thermal efficiencies.

\subsection{Stand-alone trough-Rankine system}

Steam turbine has the same main parameters and isentropic efficiency with that of the cascade system. Working pressure of deaerator is the same of the cascade system. So parameters of state $2b,s$ and $2c,s$ in Figure~\ref{fig:Stand-alone-systems} of the steam turbine can be obtained by
\nomenclature[S]{$s$}{Stand-alone systems}

\begin{equation}
	\eta_{i,tb}= (h_{2a,s}-h_{2b,s})/(h_{2a,s}-h_{i,2b,s}) = (h_{2a,s}-h_{2c,s})/(h_{2a,s}-h_{i,2c,s})
\end{equation}

The output power of steam turbine

\begin{equation}
	P_{tb,s}=\left(1-y_{s}\right)\dot{m}_{2,s}\left(h_{2a,s}-h_{2b,s}\right)+y_{s}\dot{m}_{2,s}\left(h_{2a,s}-h_{2c,s}\right)
\end{equation}

The output power of generator

\begin{equation}
	P_{ge,s}=P_{tb,s}\eta_{ge}
\end{equation}

The total power of pumps
\begin{equation}
	P_{pu,s}=\left(1-y_{s}\right)\dot{m}_{2,s}\left(h_{2e,s}-h_{2d,s}\right)+\dot{m}_{2,s}\left(h_{2g,s}-h_{2f,s}\right)
\end{equation}

Heat injected in the water circuit

\begin{equation}
	Q_{2,s}=\dot{m}_{2,s}\left(h_{2a,s}-h_{2g,s}\right)
\end{equation}

The generator efficiency is the same of that in the cascade system, and the efficiency of Rankine cycle can be expressed as

\begin{equation}
	\eta_{rk,s}=(P_{tb,s}-P_{pu,s}/\eta_{ge})/Q_{2,s}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Stand-alone dish-Stirling system}

In the stand-alone dish-Stirling system, Stirling engines with the same number of dish collectors are directly put on the focuses of the dish collectors. Water is used for cooling the Stirling engines. $T_{H,s}$ is chosen to be equal to outlet temperature of air in dish receiver. $T_{L,s}$ is chosen to be 310 K, the default expansion temperature in Fraser's dissertation~\cite{Fraser2008} for the calculation of 4-95 NK\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2} engine. $k$ and $\gamma$ are chosen the same value as that of the Stirling engines in the cascade system.

\begin{equation}
	\eta_{sea,s}=\dfrac{T_{H,s}-T_{L,s}}{T_{H,s}+\dfrac{1-e_{s}}{k-1}\cdot\dfrac{T_{H,s}-T_{L,s}}{\ln\gamma}}
\end{equation}

where, $T_{R,s}=\dfrac{T_{H,s}-T_{L,s}}{\ln(T_{H,s}/T_{L,s})}$ and $e_{s}=\dfrac{T_{R,s}-T_{L,s}}{T_{H,s}-T_{L,s}}$.

The power of Stirling engines

\begin{equation}
	P_{sea,s}=n_{dc}A_{dc}I_r\eta_{dc}\eta_{sea,s}
\end{equation}
\nomenclature{$n$}{Number of collectors}

\section{Comparison with stand-alone system}
The results presented in Table~\ref{tab:importantResults} are issued using design parameters with counterflow of two fluids in Stirling engine array as the default flow type. It is shown that the cascade system with design parameters can achieve higher efficiency compared to corresponding stand-alone systems. Although the efficiency of the Stirling engine array is lower, the efficiency of the Rankine cycle is higher. The overall output power of the cascade system is $3.83\times10^4\,\mathrm{W}$ higher.
%Different results between two flow types of Stirling engine array are listed in Table~\ref{tab:SEAresults}.

\subsection{Effects of $I_{r}$}
\label{sec:I_r}

It is found that $I_r$ can affect the efficiency difference of cascade system and stand-alone systems $\eta_{diff}$. Figure~\ref{fig:I_r-eta_diff} shows curve fits of efficiency differences $\eta_{diff}$ versus $I_r$ with a series of different Stirling engine array power ratios. As it can be seen, for a high $I_r$ ($I_r > 550\,\mathrm{W/m^2}$), $\eta_{diff}>0$, the cascade system can achieve a higher efficiency than corresponding stand-alone systems. For a low $I_r$ ($I_r < 550\,$W/m$^2$), $\eta_{diff}$ may be negative. At this situation, the cascade system achieves a lower efficiency than corresponding stand-alone systems. This may be explained that instead of cooling water in the stand-alone dish-Stirling system, condensed water of Rankine cycle is used to cool the Stirling engines, which jeopardizes the heat dissipation and leads to a lower power of the Stirling engines. For a low $I_r$, the increased power of steam turbine due to absorbed heat by the condensed water is lower than the power loss of the Stirling engines. It can also be found that higher $I_r$ can achieve higher $\eta_{diff}$, which can be interpreted as the heat absorbed by the condensed water increases with $I_r$. So a higher $I_r$ location is always more suitable for cascade system. This means $I_r$ is a key factor to determine whether cascade system should be applied in a certain location.
\nomenclature[G]{$\beta$}{Ratio of power of Stirling engines to the total output power of cascade system}

\noindent \begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width = 0.8\columnwidth, angle = 0]{fig/I_r-eta_diff}
	\caption{Curve fits of efficiency difference $\eta_{diff}$ versus $I_r$}
	\label{fig:I_r-eta_diff}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Effects of $\beta$}

As it can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:importantResults}, the $\eta_{diff}$ is very small with the design parameters given above. A reason $\eta_{diff}$ to be so small is that $\beta$, the ratio of power of Stirling engines to the total power, is very small, the heat released by the Stirling engine array is a small portion of the heat absorbed in the Rankine cycle. So increase $\beta$ may achieve higher $\eta_{diff}$. The relationship between $\eta_{diff}$ and $\beta$ under a series of $I_r$ is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:beta-eta_diff}. It can be found that, for a high $I_r$, increase $\beta$ may achieve a higher $\eta_{diff}$, but there is a limit. For $I_r=900$W/m$^2$, the maximum $\eta_{diff}=0.0228$ appears at $\beta=0.23$. For a low $I_r$, $\eta_{diff}$ is negative, increase $\beta$ will reduce $\eta_{diff}$. This can be explained as the same reason in section~\ref{sec:I_r}.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Effects of flow type}

Flow type between heating and cooling streams can affect the efficiency of Stirling engine array. Parallel flow, compared to counterflow, leads to higher Stirling engine efficiency in the first columns of the array for lower cooling temperature, while lower Stirling engine efficiency in the last columns for higher cooling temperature.

\end{figure}

It can be concluded that the temperature increment of cooling fluid is much smaller than the temperature decrement of heating fluid due to their large difference of $c_pq_m$, which leads to a small difference of overall efficiency of Stirling engine array between the two flow types.

To find out a clear difference of the two flow types, a simple model of Stirling engine array was developed with air as the heating fluid and water as the cooling fluid. $T_{1,i}, T_{1,o}, T_{2,i}, q_{1,m}$ are fixed and chosen the same values as in the cascade system. Change the value of $q_{2,m}$, and the corresponding Stirling engine array efficiency of the two flow types ($\eta_p$ and $\eta_c$) can be obtained. Figure~\ref{fig:SEAflowtypes} shows the efficiency of Stirling engine array with different $q_{2,m}$ in two flow types. It can be found that counterflow has a higher efficiency than parallel flow, and with lower $q_{2,m}$ comes with higher efficiency difference.
\nomenclature[S]{$p$}{Parallel flow}
\nomenclature[S]{$c$}{Counterflow}

For a system with large difference of $c_pq_m$ of two fluids, that means one fluid can only achieve a small temperature rise (drop) compared to the other fluid, will lead to a small difference of two flow types. For a system with similar difference of $c_pq_m$, use the counterflow can achieve a higher efficiency.
