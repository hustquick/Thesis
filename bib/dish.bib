	Abstract = {Abstract In this paper, thermal performance analysis of 20 m2 prototype fuzzy focal solar dish collector is presented. The focal image characteristics of the solar dish are determined to propose the suitable design of absorber/receiver. First, theoretical thermal performance analysis of the fuzzy focal solar parabolic dish concentrator with modified cavity receiver is carried out for different operating conditions. Based on the theoretical performance analysis, the total heat loss (conduction, convection and radiation heat losses) from the modified cavity receiver is estimated. It is observed that the maximum theoretical efficiencies of solar dish collector are found to be as 79.2\% for no wind conditions and 78.2\% and 77.8\% for side-on and head-on winds speed of 5 m/s respectively. Latter, real time analysis of parabolic dish collector with modified cavity receiver is carried out in terms of stagnation test, time constant test and daily performance test. From stagnation test, the overall heat loss coefficient is found to be 356 W/m2 K. The time constant test is carried out to determine the influence of sudden change in solar radiation at steady state conditions. The daily performance tests are conducted for different flow rates. It is found that the efficiency of the collector increases with the increase of volume flow rates. The average thermal efficiencies of the parabolic dish collector for the volume flow rate of 100 L/h and 250 L/h are found to be 69\% and 74\% for the average beam radiation (Ibn) of 532 W/m2 and 641 W/m2 respectively. },

	Abstract = {Abstract The solar receiver plays a key role in the performance of a solar dish electric generator. Its radiation flux distribution can directly affect the efficiency of the parabolic solar concentrator system. In this paper, radiation flux distribution of the receiver is simulated successfully using \{MCRT\} method. The impacts of incident solar irradiation, aspect ratio (the ratio of the receiver height to the receiver diameter), and system error on the radiation flux of the receiver are investigated. The parameters are studied in the following ranges: incident solar irradiation from 100 to 1100 W/m2, receiver aspect ratio from 0.5 to 1.5, and the system error from 0 to 10 mrad. A non-dimensional parameter Θ is defined to represent the ratio of radiation flux to incident solar irradiation. The results show that the maximum of Θ is about 200 in simulation conditions. The aspect ratio and system error have a significant impact on the radiation flux. The optimal receiver aspect ratio is 1.5 at a constant incident solar irradiation, and the maximum of radiation flux increases with decreasing system error, however, the radiation flux distribution can benefit from a large system error. Meanwhile, effects of integral dish and multi-dishes on the radiation flux distribution have been investigated. The results show that the accuracy of two cases can be ignored within the same parameters. },

	Abstract = {Abstract In this article, total heat losses from three configurations of modified cavity receiver of solar parabolic dish are investigated using 3-D numerical model. The effects of various parameters such as diameter ratio (d/D), angle of inclination (θ), operating temperature (T), insulation thickness (t) and emissivity (ε) of the cavity cover on the heat losses from the modified cavity receiver are investigated. The variable boundary conditions are considered for modified cavity receiver to produce sub-cooled hot water, saturated steam and superheated steam. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is developed to predict the heat loss for a large set of influencing parameters. Based on \{ANN\} modelling, improved Nusselt number correlations are proposed for convective, radiative and total heat losses from the modified cavity receiver. The convective heat losses are greatly influenced by receiver inclination whereas the radiation heat losses are influenced by the cavity cover emissivity. The diameter ratio also plays a major role in heat losses from the cavity receiver. The total heat loss is estimated as 522 W for superheat steam condition for θ = 0 and d/D = 0.05; whereas it is 288 W for diameter ratio 1. The total heat loss varies 25\% for inclinations 0 and 90$\,^{\circ}$. For saturated and sub-cooled steam conditions, the total heat loss variation is found to be 28\% and 21\% respectively from 0 to 90$\,^{\circ}$ inclinations for diameter ratio of 0.05. The present method predicts the heat losses more accurately compared with the existing models. },

From a hot climate perspective, there is a huge potential available for low-cost solar water heating systems. With the system described in this paper, the needs of hot water in the domestic sector can be fulfilled instantly. Authors used the parabolic dish collector for instant water heating. This paper describes the effect of variation of mass flow rate on performance of the parabolic dish water heater prototype.

@article{Skouri2013,
	Abstract = {Abstract The purpose of this work is to evaluate the energy coming to the focus of a solar parabolic concentrator \{SPC\} using four types of absorbers: flat plate, disk, water calorimeter (WC) and solar heat exchanger (SHE), developed in the Research and Technologies Centre of Energy in Borj Cedria in Tunisia (CRTEn). The temperature of the absorber, the solar energy absorbed by the receiver, the mean concentration ratio and both energy and exergy efficiency of the system were obtained experimentally. In order to validate the experimental results of the \{SHE\} and to determine the \{SPC\} efficiency using the disk, an analytical study based on thermodynamics analysis is carried out. We note that a good agreement between the four experimental methods has been obtained with the four receivers used in this work. The thermal energy efficiency varies from 40\% to 77\%, the concentrating system reaches an average exergy efficiency of 50\% and a concentration factor around 178. },

	Abstract = {Abstract An experimental setup to investigate the thermal performance of a cylindrical cavity receiver for an SK-14 parabolic dish concentrator is presented in this technical note. The thermal performance is evaluated using energy and exergy analyses. The receiver exergy rates and efficiencies are found to be appreciably smaller than the receiver energy rates and efficiencies. The exergy factor parameter is also proposed for quantifying the thermal performance. The exergy factor is found to be high under conditions of high solar radiation and under high operating temperatures. The heat loss factor of the receiver is determined to be around 4.6 W/K. An optical efficiency of around 52\% for parabolic dish system is determined under high solar radiation conditions. This experimental setup can be used as teaching tool for people with little or no knowledge about solar dish concentrators due its simplicity and the basic mathematical formulations applied. Different types of receivers and different types of deep focal region parabolic dishes can also be tested with the experimental setup. },

	Abstract = {Abstract In this article, a 3-D numerical modeling is carried out to determine combined convection and surface radiation heat losses from a modified cavity receiver of parabolic dish collector used as mono-tube boiler for sub-cooled, saturated and superheated steam generation conditions. The forced convection heat loss from the modified cavity receiver is estimated using Nusselt number correlation developed for the modified cavity receiver. The effect of receiver inclination ( β ) , operating temperature ( T w ) , emissivity of the cavity cover ( ∊ ) , thickness of insulation ( t ins ) on the combined heat losses from the modified cavity receiver is investigated. The boundary conditions for wall temperature and insulation thicknesses are chosen to match the three steam generation conditions. It is found that the natural convection heat losses are higher at β = 0 $\,^{\circ}$ (receiver facing sideward) and lower at β = 90 $\,^{\circ}$ (receiver facing down) whereas the forced convection heat loss is higher at β = 90 $\,^{\circ}$ and lower at β = 0 $\,^{\circ}$ . The variation of radiation heat losses is marginal for all values of β and vary with T w . The effect of various parameters such as receiver inclination, wind direction ( φ ) , wind speed and diameter ratios on forced convection heat loss from the receiver has also been studied. The forced convection heat loss at lower wind speeds (&lt;2.5 m/s) is lower than the natural convection heat losses. The maximum heat losses occur at side-on wind direction ( φ = 0 ) followed by head-on wind directions ( φ = 30--90$\,^{\circ}$) and back-on wind directions ( φ = - 90 $\,^{\circ}$ to - 30 $\,^{\circ}$ ) . The heat losses vary with diameter ratios for different configurations of the receiver. The forced convection heat loss is 1.2--9 times higher than natural convection heat loss for diameter ratio (ratio of cavity diameter to aperture diameter, d/D) = 0.4 at 5 m/s and receiver inclinations varying from 0$\,^{\circ}$ to 90 $\,^{\circ}$ . Nusselt number correlations have been proposed based on the numerical analysis to estimate the combined convective and radiative heat loss. The present study attempts to estimate natural convection, forced convection and surface radiation heat losses from the modified cavity receiver under various conditions. },

	Abstract = {Abstract The performance of solar parabolic dish collector is significantly influenced by heat losses due to wind speed and direction. In this article, investigation of convective heat losses from the modified cavity receiver of solar parabolic dish collector is carried out numerically by considering the wind direction, wind speed, receiver configuration and receiver orientation. The effect of wind on the receiver in various directions (φ = −90$\,^{\circ}$ to 90$\,^{\circ}$), wide range of operating wind speeds (V = 0--10 m/s), receiver inclinations (β = 0--90$\,^{\circ}$) and varying surface temperature on convective heat loss from the receiver are studied. Velocity vectors, velocity contours, temperature contours are presented to show the effect of wind on the heat loss from the modified cavity receiver. The forced convection is found to have similar trend of free convection heat loss at lower wind speed. However at higher wind speed, such a pattern is not observed. At lower wind speeds say less than critical wind speed (&lt;2.5 m/s), the forced convection heat loss is lower than natural convection heat loss for lower receiver inclinations and wind direction ranging between −90$\,^{\circ}$ and 0$\,^{\circ}$. The forced convection heat loss is more significant than free convection heat loss above 5 m/s for all φ and β values. For side-on winds, at higher wind speeds above 5 m/s, irrespective of receiver inclination, the variation of forced convection heat loss is marginal (less than 5\%). The maximum forced convection heat loss occurs for partly open receivers (receiver aperture diameter ratio, \{RAD\} = 0.4 and 0.6) at φ = 0 (side-on wind) for all receiver inclinations and at φ = 30$\,^{\circ}$ for \{RAD\} = 0.8 and 1. The receiver inclination has less effect on heat loss from the receiver for V &gt; 2.5 m/s due to side-on wind. The highest convection heat loss occurs for fully open (RAD = 1) receiver as compared to partly open (RAD &lt; 1) modified cavity receiver. Nusselt number correlation is proposed to calculate combined convection heat losses from the receiver as a function of receiver inclination, wind direction, wind velocity and aperture diameter ratio. },
