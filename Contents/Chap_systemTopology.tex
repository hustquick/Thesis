\chapter{System topology}
\label{cha:SystemTopology}

After the analysis of \autoref{cha:Introduction}, this thesis determines the research goal and the research content. The selection of cascade system topology is a prerequisite directly related to whether the cascade system can operate safely and efficiently. A cascade system with an unreasonable topology does not even work. Based on the existing mature CSP technology, this chapter analysis and excludes various technical schemes and related components for cascade system. Through reasonable layout, effective Solar cascade thermal power generation topologies are chosen.

Three solar thermal power generation technologies are commercially proven -- parabolic trough, parabolic dish and solar tower. 
Considering the future deployment of solar cascade demo system, two solar thermal technologies, parabolic trough and parabolic dish, are chosen as the basic systems for the design of cascade solar thermal power system. For the cascade utilization of the high temperature heat obtained from the parabolic dish receiver, air (or nitrogen) is used as the HTF to transfer the heat collected.
\autoref{fig:PTPD} shows the schematic diagrams of a parabolic trough system and a parabolic dish system. To make the system structure diagrams in this thesis more clearly and consistent, legends of the components that may appear in solar power systems are listed in \autoref{fig:Legends}.

Based on the two basic systems, different system topologies can be applied to achieve energy cascade collection and cascade utilization. As the cascade system topology needs to consider a variety of options, such as the selection of Rankine cycle structure, with the integration of solar chimney technology, different types of collector integration, Rankine cycle and Stirling cycle integration. The number of combined topologies is very large. In order to obtain the most suitable cascade system topology, these factors need to be carefully analyzed one by one in terms of feasibility and economy. It should be noted that the study conducted in this thesis did not consider heat storage system due to: (1) This thesis focuses on the theoretical analysis of energy cascade collection and cascade utilization. It mainly considers to use different collectors to achieve energy cascade collection and use different thermodynamic cycles to achieve energy cascade utilization. It takes no consideration of the influence of the heat storage system. (2) The existence of heat storage system will change matching between heat collection temperature and heating temperature, which brings additional work for system analysis. (3) This test platform is only used for experimental research. It does not consider the connection with state grid. The apply of heat storage system will add the cost. (4) The heat storage system can be added in the future research work without affecting the research content and conclusion of this thesis.

\section{System topology based on Rankine cycle}
\label{sec:strc}

The system structure of Rankine cycle is mainly affected by Rankine cycle fluid, typical structure diagrams of SRC solar thermal system and ORC solar thermal system are shown in \autoref{fig:TypicalSteamRankineSolarSystem} and \autoref{fig:TypicalOrganicRankineSolarSystem} respectively. This section mainly focuses on the selection of Rankine cycle fluid.

\subsection{Ideal Rankine cycle fluid}
\label{sec:ircf}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering 
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig/idealTs}
\caption{Temperature-entropy diagram of an ideal working fluid}\label{fig:idealTs}
\end{figure}

Different working fluids for Rankine cycle would have the temperature-entropy curves given in \autoref{fig:idealTs}. It should be noted that each curve in the figure is only used to represent the saturation curve shape of different working fluids. The entropy and temperature value corresponding to the curve do not represent the true entropy and temperature value, nor can they be used for comparison between different working fluids. Among them, the ideal working fluid has the following characteristics~\cite{Abbin1977}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The heat capacity of saturated liquid should be small. This makes the curve 22' in \autoref{fig:idealTs} almost vertical.
  \item The critical point should be above the highest operating temperature to allow all heat to be added at that temperature.
  \item The vapor pressure at the highest operating temperature should be moderate for safety reasons and to reduce the cost of the equipment.
  \item The vapor pressure at the condensing temperature should be above atmospheric pressure to prevent air leakage into the system.
  \item The specific volume of the vapor at state 4 should be small to avoid large-diameter turbine wheels, casings, and heat exchangers.
  \item The saturated vapor curve 3-4 in \autoref{fig:idealTs} should be vertical to avoid expansion into the wet vapor region (negative $ds/dT$) or expansion into the superheat region (positive $ds/dT$).
  \item For low-power turbine applications, the fluid should have a high molecular weight to minimize the rotational speed and/or the number of turbine stages and to allow for reasonable mass flow rates and turbine nozzle areas.
  \item The fluid should be liquid at atmospheric pressure and temperature for ease of handling and containment.
  \item The freezing point should be lower than the lowest ambient operating temperature.
  \item The fluid should have good heat-transfer properties, be inexpensive, thermally stable at the highest operating temperature, nonflammable, noncorrosive, nontoxic, and so on.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{SRC and ORC}

Water is the most commonly used fluid for Rankine cycle, it is more mature to design Rankine cycle components for steam systems than any other liquid. It is inexpensive to use (although boiler-grade water must be highly distilled and thus costs more than tap water), sealing of the high-pressure portions of a Rankine cycle using steam is not critical. Non-flammability and ready availability of steam are additional advantages. Because it has a critical temperature and pressure of 374$\mathrm{^\circ C}$ and 22.1$\,\mathrm{MPa}$, it can be used for systems operating at fairly high temperatures with most of the heat addition (at constant temperature) and at moderate pressure. \autoref{fig:TypicalSteamRankineSolarSystem} shows the schematic diagram of a typical steam Rankine cycle solar system.

There are some disadvantages for steam as the Rankine cycle fluid. The low temperature characteristics of steam are not ideal because the steam has a low vapor pressure and a very low density at ambient temperature (see \autoref{tab:waterT_P_D}). Therefore, sealing air from low pressure components is a major design problem.
\begin{table}[htbp]

\end{table}

The organic Rankine cycle can be used in the solar parabolic trough technology in place of the usual steam Rankine cycle. The ORC allows power generation at lower capacities and with a lower collector temperature, and hence the possibility for low-cost, small scale decentralized CSP units. Most organic fluids used in organic Rankine cycle are drying fluids. The vapor leaving the expander still contains heat that can be transferred to the compressed liquid stream because the turbine outlet temperature is above the condenser temperature. A vapor-to-liquid heat exchanger in \autoref{fig:TypicalOrganicRankineSolarSystem}, known as a regenerator, is typically used for this purpose.

Compared with steam for the Rankine cycle, it has the following advantages:
\begin{itemize}
  \item  Small turbine head allows for moderate shaft speed and a single- or two-stage design.
    \item Low volume ratio facilitates the flow path design.
    \item High volume flow and low velocity of sound results in reasonable flow areas.
    \item Low temperature drop during expansion reduces thermal stress problems.
    \item Dry expansion avoids blade erosion caused by vapor wetness.
    \item Low system pressure facilitates housing design.
  \end{itemize}
  
\subsection{Selection of Rankine cycle fluid}

There are two important aspects to consider when selecting the working fluid of the Rankine cycle solar power system:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Select the working fluid that is conducive to the optimization of the cycle efficiency.  
  For a Rankine cycle solar system, the collector efficiency reduces with operating temperature, and the Rankine cycle efficiency increases with operating temperature, there exists an optimal operating temperature as illustrated in \autoref{fig:Efficiency}. The working fluid should be conducive to achieve the optimal operating temperature.
  
  \item The working fluid state matches the heat transfer fluid state, if heat transfer fluid is used.
    On the one hand, the operating temperature of the working fluid should be lower than the collecting temperature of the HTF. On the other hand, the operating temperature of the working fluid should not be much lower than the collecting temperature of the HTF to avoid large exergy loss during the heat exchange process.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering 
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig/Efficiency}
\caption{Efficiency variation with operating temperature}\label{fig:Efficiency}
\end{figure}

Based on the advantages and disadvantages of water and organic fluid as the working fluid of Rankine cycle, it is clear that, for low operating temperature and small capacity distribution power generation, organic fluid will be a better choice, otherwise water is the better one. Bao and Zhao~\cite{Bao2013} presented a comprehensive review of working fluid selection (including pure fluids and mixtures). In this review, many factors such as operating conditions, working fluid characteristics, equipment structures and environmental safety considerations were considered.

\section{System structure of trough-Rankine integrated with solar chimney}

Solar chimney, also known as solar updraft tower, directly (without concentration) uses the sun's heat to generate power. It uses solar radiation to increase the internal air temperature to form a flow to the chimney located at the middle of the roof. \autoref{fig:SolarChimney} shows the schematic diagram of a typical solar chimney power plant. In this plant, air is heated by the green house effect under the translucent roof. As the roof is open at its periphery, air flows into the plant due to different density distribution. Hot air flows into the chimney because of buoyancy. An electricity-generating turbine is set in the path of the air current to convert the kinetic energy of the air flow into electricity.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering 
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig/SolarChimney}
\caption{Schematic diagram of a solar chimney power plant}\label{fig:SolarChimney}
\end{figure}

The solar chimney can use the low temperature (low grade energy) for power generation. So the combination of parabolic trough system and solar chimney is considered an effective way for energy cascade utilization. In the combined system, the condenser in the Rankine cycle is air cooled. The fan blows the hot air that has cooled the condenser into the solar chimney power plant from its periphery. The hot air stream converges at the bottom of chimney, flows upward with the action of buoyancy and drives the turbine in the chimney.
Energy of the hot air can be utilized by the solar chimney. \autoref{fig:CombinedSolarChimney} shows an example of the combined system. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering 
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{fig/CombinedSolarChimney}
\caption{Schematic diagram of a combined solar trough and chimney power system}\label{fig:CombinedSolarChimney}
\end{figure}

However, the efficiency of current solar chimney system is very low. Primary design data of solar chimney power plants with different location, different chimney height and collector height are shown in \autoref{tab:sc}~\cite{Bilgen2005}. The preliminary design parameters are selected and determined for a nominal solar irradiation intensity of 1000$\,\mathrm{W/m^2}$ and the nominal plant power of 5$\,\mathrm{MW}$. From the table, it can be found that the chimney efficiency and total efficiency are very low and the technology is still in the developing stage.

Besides, a solar chimney is costly and requires vast land, which is adverse to the future deployment of solar cascade demo system. With these considerations, the solar chimney plans are not adopted for the cascade system. 

\section{Multiply types of collectors}

Considering different heat collecting temperatures of different types of collectors, series connection of different types of collectors can be a feasible choice for solar cascade collection. Trough collectors and Fresnel collectors have better performance and lower cost for lower temperature heat collection. Dish collectors and solar towers are more suitable for higher temperature heat collection. Serial connection utilize the advantages of different types of collectors. \autoref{fig:SeriesCollector} shows an example of a cascade system using collector series connection. In this system, air, the HTF, is preheated by parabolic collectors before it flows into the parabolic dish collectors.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering 
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig/SeriesCollector}
\caption{Schematic diagram of a cascade system using collector series connection}\label{fig:SeriesCollector}
\end{figure}

In this configuration, air is heated in the trough collectors and dish receivers consequently. After providing heat for the Stirling engines, the hot air flows into the heat exchanger to provide heat for the Rankine cycle. In this topology, air is used as the HTF for the solar trough, this idea is only numerically and experimentally studied,~\cite{Good2015,Good2016} no commercial applications can be found up to now. This technology is mainly constrained by the low conductivity and low heat capacity of air, which leads to low system efficiency. For this consideration, this topology is not adopted due to the air parabolic trough technology.

It can be a good choice to apply flat plate solar collectors and parabolic trough collectors in traditional solar power tower plant that uses water as the HTF (such as Solar One). As demonstrated in \autoref{fig:seriesCollection}, condensed water is heated by the flat plate solar collectors and feedwater is heated by the parabolic trough collectors. Flat plate collectors and parabolic trough collectors have much lower unit thermal cost compared to solar power tower. The addition of flat plate collectors and parabolic trough collectors can effectively reduce the cost of the system. Although this scheme is promising and deserves further research, the cascade system in this thesis will not consider it for the requirement of solar power tower is adverse to the deployment of cascade demo system.

\section{Rankine cycle and Stirling cycle integrated system}

\subsection{Heat exchange between circuits}

Heat transfer between different circuits can be applied for cascade utilization of the heat collected. Depending on the two basic solar system as shown in \autoref{fig:PTPD}, there are two types of heat exchangers that can be applied in the cascade solar system.

Two types of heat exchangers may be applied in the solar thermal cascade system -- the air-oil heat exchanger (see in \autoref{fig:air-oil_c}) and the air-water heat exchanger (see in \autoref{fig:air-water_c}). 

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering 
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{fig/air-oil}
\caption{Schematic diagram of a solar system using air-oil heat exchanger}\label{fig:air-oil_c}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
	\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.4\columnwidth}
	\includegraphics[width = \columnwidth]{fig/air-water1}
	\caption{}\label{fig:air-water_1_c}
	\end{subfigure}
	~
\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.4\columnwidth}
	\includegraphics[width = \columnwidth]{fig/air-water2}
	\caption{}\label{fig:air-water_2_c}
	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Schematic diagrams of two kinds of solar systems using air-water heat exchanger}
	\label{fig:air-water_c}
\end{figure}

For the first type, air provides heat for oil. It is not economic for several reasons. First, The temperature of the heat transfer oil can not be further increased. The temperature of the oil is not limited by the parabolic trough collectors. The temperature of the oil is constrained by the oil properties and heat collecting temperature of the trough collectors can exceed this value. In high temperature conditions, oil may deterioration, evaporation, decompose, which has a negative impact on the stable and safe operation of the system. Second, using dish to provide heat for the oil is not suitable since the dish is designed for higher temperature collections and it's less cost-effective compared with parabolic trough.

For the second type, air provides heat for water. Two kinds of solar systems using air-water heat exchanger can be found in \autoref{fig:air-water_c}. \autoref{fig:air-water_1_c} shows the scheme that air after the Stirling engine is used to overheat the steam. It's feasible since the air can increase the average temperature of the endothermic process of the water to increase the efficiency of Rankine cycle. On the other hand, in a conventional solar trough system, the main steam temperature is limited by the oil, which is not conductive to Rankine cycle efficiency. In this proposed cascade system, the main steam temperature of the Rankine cycle can be raised to be higher than 400$\mathrm{^\circ C}$ to eliminate the negative effect of the oil.
This is the scheme that will be discussed in detail in the next few chapters. \autoref{fig:air-water_2_c} shows the scheme that air after the Stirling engine is used to preheat the feed water. It is not a good choice since the temperature difference of the heat transfer process is large and it provides no benefits to increase the inlet temperature of the steam turbine.

\subsection{Heat recovery between cycles}

According to the second law of thermodynamics, it is impossible for any device that operates on a cycle to receive heat from a single reservoir and produces a net amount of work. For a heat engine, it requires both a hot source and a cold sink to convert heat energy to mechanical energy. 
\autoref{fig:engines} shows the thermodynamic conversion diagram of a typical heat engine. In a thermodynamic cycle, heat is absorbed from the hot source, only part of it can be converted into mechanical work by the engine. The conversion ratio related to the temperatures of hot source and cold sink is fundamentally limited by Carnot's theorem.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering 
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig/engines}
\caption{Diagram of a typical heat engine}\label{fig:engines}
\end{figure}

Only those engines suitable for external heating are usually considered for solar applications. Unlike an internal combustion engine that generates heat within the working fluid, an externally heated engine needs external heat to be added to the working fluid by a heat exchanger.

Three types of engines are designed to accept external heat and have been used for solar heat sources: the Rankine, the Stirling, and the Brayton cycles~\cite{Roschke1979}. The Rankine and Brayton cycles are both suitable for constant-pressure heat-addition. 
The original Brayton engine uses piston compressors and piston expanders, but more modern gas turbines and airbreathing jet engines also follow the Brayton cycle. Although the cycle is usually an open system, in order to carry out thermodynamic analysis, usually it is assumed that exhaust gases are reused as the intake so that the whole process can be analyzed as a closed cycle.
The Stirling machine uses a reciprocating piston design that allows external heating to be combined into its constant-temperature heat-addition process. 
In a Rankine cycle, the pressurized liquid enters a heat exchanger where it is heated at constant pressure by an external heat source to become vapor.

These three kinds of cycles work at different optimum operating temperatures. Rankine cycle works with the lowest hot source temperature and Brayton works with the highest. \autoref{fig:cycles} shows the diagram of the three cycles used in solar energy. The heat released by these cycles may be recovered by another cycle (as a bottom cycle).

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering 
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig/cycles}
\caption{Diagram of three cycles used in solar energy}\label{fig:cycles}
\end{figure}

Different thermodynamic cycles work at different optimum working temperatures. Since each thermodynamic cycle has endothermic and exothermic processes, a bottoming cycle may use the released heat of a topping cycle.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
	\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.4\columnwidth}

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Two configurations with heat recovery between thermodynamic cycles}
	\label{fig:coupledCycles}
\end{figure}

In our basic systems (see \autoref{fig:PTPD}), Rankine cycle and Stirling cycle can be coupled for cascade usage. 
\autoref{fig:coupledCycles} shows two configurations of the cascade systems with heat recovery between cycles. 
For a traditional Stirling engine, to enhance the performance, cooling water is used to absorb the heat released by the engine. The absorbed heat is wasted without reuse.
In \autoref{fig:Stirling-Rankine}, condensate of the Rankine cycle is used to cool the Stirling engine. Rejected heat of the Stirling cycle can be recycled by Rankine cycle. 
For organic Rankine cycles, different working fluids determine the working temperature zones. It is feasible to reuse the condensation heat of an organic Rankine cycle by another organic Rankine cycle.
In \autoref{fig:Rankine-Rankine}, two organic Rankine are coupled together for power generation. The bottoming cycle uses the condensation heat of the topping cycle for preheating, evaporation and superheating.

\section{Selected system topology}
\label{sec:sst}
Considered all the conditions in the above sections, two system topologies are chosen for this research as shown in \autoref{fig:CascadeSystems}.

	\caption{}\label{fig:CascadeSystem2}
	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Two selected typical cascade systems}
	\label{fig:CascadeSystems}
\end{figure}

In \autoref{fig:CascadeSystem1}, the cascade system has the following features:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Multiple types of collectors.} Trough collectors are applied for lower temperature heat collection and dish collectors are applied for higher temperature heat collection. This helps to reduce the cost and improve the efficiency.
  \item \emph{Multiple types of thermodynamic cycles.} Rankine cycle is applied for lower temperature heat utilization. Stirling cycle is applied for higher temperature heat utilization.
  \item \emph{Air-water heat exchanger.} An extra air-water heat exchanger is applied to increase the temperature of the main steam, which helps to improve the efficiency of Rankine cycle. On the other hand, it can overcome the disadvantage of low limit temperature of heat transfer oil in conventional solar trough systems, which helps to achieve higher main steam parameters than traditional solar trough systems. 
  \item \emph{Condensate for Stirling engine cooling.} Condensate of the Rankine cycle is used to cool the Stirling engine. Rejected heat of the Stirling cycle can be reused by Rankine cycle, which helps to improve the overall system efficiency.
\end{itemize}

In \autoref{fig:CascadeSystem2}, the cascade system also has the features mentioned above. Besides, it uses different kinds of organic fluid as the working fluid, which adapts more general working temperature for solar energy systems. \autoref{fig:Ex_CascadeSystem2} shows a calculation example of the cascade system.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{fig/Ex_CascadeSystem2}
\caption{A calculation example of cascade system shown in \autoref{fig:CascadeSystem2}}
\label{fig:Ex_CascadeSystem2}
\end{figure}

Both cascade systems will be modeled for investigation. However, considering the more extensive application of steam Rankine cycle, the system described in \autoref{fig:CascadeSystem1} will be used as the main research content in the following chapters.

\section{Conclusion}
This chapter systematically introduces a number of considerations in cascade solar thermal system design. These considerations include Rankine cycle fluid type, solar chimney, collector series connection, heat exchanger between circuits and heat recovery between cycles. 

These considerations are carefully checked for the cascade system study. Combining with the research direction, two typical system topologies suitable for the deployment of cascade demo system are put forward. These two typical system topologies have the following features:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Multiple types of collectors are applied.
  \item Multiple kinds of thermodynamic cycles are applied. 
  \item Air-water heat exchanger is applied to increase the Rankine cycle efficiency.
  \item Condensate for Stirling engine cooling to recover the heat rejected by the engine.
\end{itemize}

It is worthy noting that some of the considerations of the system topology design deserves more concern in the future. For example, a solar power tower combined with parabolic trough collectors and flat plates as shown in \autoref{fig:seriesCollection} effectively utilizes the characteristics of the collectors.
