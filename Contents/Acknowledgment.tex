%  This is the acknowledgment part.  
%  
%I have greatly appreciated the technical support, freedom, and detailed advice offered by my superviser Huang Shuhong, Inmaculada Arauzo and Zhang Yanping. They contributed much more time and effort to my research and reports than I expected. My technical skills have been greatly improved as a result of working and learning with them.
%  
%I have also been grateful for the flexibility offered by Nate Blair and Mark Mehos from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) who provided the financial support for this research. I was able to research a large variety of topics related to Stirling dish systems with their continued support and interest.
%  
%Chuck Andraka from Sandia National Laboratories provided crucial data for validating the models in this research. His knowledge of Stirling dish systems and technical papers also allowed for a much better understanding of factors that affected the performance of these systems.

%This project was financially supported by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) under contract number ADC-5-55027-01.

I offer the sincerest gratitude to my supervisors Prof. Wei Gao, Inmaculada Arauzo and Yanping Zhang. They contributed much more time and effort to my research and reports than I expected. My technical skills have been greatly improved as a result of working and learning with them.

I also owe my gratitude to Prof. Shuhong Huang. It would not have been possible to complete my research on the solar thermal power without his help. Prof. Huang spent a lot of time for the coordination and technology improvement. 

Thanks to my research partners, Chongzhe Zou, Xiaohong Huang, and Xiaolin Lei. They provided a good study atmosphere.
Owing to their efforts, the cascade solar thermal test system is under construction and experiment investigation thereby  will be carried out.

Thanks are given to the support of International S$\&$T Cooperation Program of China, under Grant No. 2014DFA60990.
