2004年，还是年少的我，作为本科生进入华中科技大学能源与动力工程学院，如今已过而立之年，博士论文修改工作的基本完成，预示着我在这里的学生生活即将结束。尽管这段难忘的人生时光曾经让我一度灰心丧气，但当我踉踉跄跄地要离开这片陪伴我成长的土地，我依旧感恩在这里经历的所有艰辛与快乐，因为这里有着我在学业和生活上的满满收获，并将改变我的人生行程。
对一个地方的不舍，源于那里有让我想念的人。感谢导师黄树红教授，师从恩师六年，在为人为学方面我受益良多。犹记当年保研初见与读博抉择之时，承蒙恩师不弃，硕博六年，跟随恩师进入太阳能光热发电研究领域。一路跌跌撞撞，如果学生在学术训练上有所长进的话，端赖恩师悉心指导。与您相处以来，深受您为学之风与为人之道的感染，您独到的学术见解与敏锐的学术思维，总让我豁然开朗，倍受启发。您离开后，思念恩师，每每论文遇阻，感到沮丧之时，莫名时常梦见恩师，想起您以往的教诲与鼓励，总能重新树立学术自信，静下心来投入论文撰写。师恩如山，静默无言，当面聆听恩师讲学论道是我珍藏的回忆，恩师深邃的学术思想与坚定的学术热爱将不断为我指引航向。
感谢在读期间于不同方面给予我指导和帮助的老师们。感谢张燕平副教授时常督促我的学习与写作，时刻关注论文的阶段性进展，并对论文行进中的困难给予及时的智慧点拨。感谢您在论文修改中，就篇幅结构安排、核心实验设计提出的诸多建设性意见。感谢高伟教授，他那优雅的气质，宽广的胸怀，和蔼的态度和优异的学习方法，为我们树立了良好的榜样。感谢萨拉格萨大学的Professor Inmaculada Arauzo，有幸2015年跟随您到西班牙访学一年，开启全新的学术视野。您随和的为人、热情的问询，让我的访学生活温暖而充实。尤其在实验数据验证遇到困惑时，您耐心帮助我运用各种计算方法，使我茅塞顿开。我也向贺国强老师和杨涛老师表示感谢，他们对我的关心和照顾使我倍感亲切。匆匆数年，论文撰写与实验操作几经曲折，学业的顺利完成，离不开各位老师的不吝教诲与鼓励。
《学记》有云，“独学而无友，则孤陋而寡闻”。在课题组这个学术团队中，我幸运地结识吕方明、王际洲等同学，与他们共同交流学习，让我接触到许多闪光的学术观点。在与Rahul and Daniel等国际学友一起学习、一起生活的过程中，我不仅提高英语交流、写作能力，还收获了友谊。
最后，感谢家人的理解与支持。感谢我的父母含辛茹苦供我读书，一直做我的坚强后盾，只盼我学有所成。感谢我的妻子，在女儿桐桐出生后，挑起照料这个小生命的重担。感谢桐桐开心果，你的乖巧和可爱让我时刻感到贴心，充满动力。
而立之年，即将走出校园，这将是我人生道路的新起点。我将不忘初心、不负韶华，带着感恩与期许，用心经营好新的生活。
