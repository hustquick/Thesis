\section{Solar Parabolic Trough}\label{sec:pt}

Parabolic trough solar technology is the most proven and lowest cost large-scale solar power technology available.~\cite{Price2002}

Figure~\ref{fig:pt} shows a parabolic trough product made by Alpha-E.

Padilla~\cite{Padilla2011} performed a detailed one dimensional numerical heat transfer analysis of a PTC (Parabolic Trough Collector).  To solve the mathematical model of heat transfer of the PTC model, the partial differential equations were discretized and the nonlinear algebraic equations were solved simultaneously. The numerical results was validated to the data from Sandia National Laboratory (SNL).

\nomenclature[C]{SNL}{Sandia National Laboratory}

To understand the thermal performance of the collector and identify the heat losses from the collector, Mohamad~\cite{Mohamad2014} analyzed the temperature variation of the working fluid, tube and glass along the collector.

Guo~\cite{JiangfengGuo2016-1} investigated the energy efficiency and exergy efficiency of the parabolic trough collector. The result shown that there exists an optimal mass flow rate of working fluid for exergy efficiency, and the thermal efficiency and exergy efficiency have opposite changing tendencies under some conditions.

Guo~\cite{JiangfengGuo2016-2} implemented a multi-parameter optimization of parabolic trough solar receiver based on genetic algorithm where Exergy and thermal efficiencies were employed as objective function.

Padilla~\cite{Padilla2014} performed a comprehensive exergy balance of a parablic trough collector based on the previous heat transfer model~\cite{Padilla2011}. The results shown that inlet temperature of heat transfer fluid, solar irradiance, and vacuum in annulus have a significant effect on the thermal and exergetic performance, but the effect of wind speed and mass flow rate of heat transfer fluid is negligible. It was obtained that inlet temperature of heat transfer fluid cannot be optimized to achieve simultaneously maximum thermal and exergetic efficiency because they exhibit opposite trends. Finally, it was found that the highest exergy destruction is due to the heat transfer between the sun and the absorber while for exergy losses is due to optical error.

Huang~\cite{Huang2012} proposed an analytical model for optical performance which employed a modified integration algorithm.

Wang~\cite{Wang2016} proposed a mathematical model for the optical efficiency of the parabolic trough solar collector and selected three typical regions of solar thermal utilization in China for the model. The model is validated by comparing the test results in parabolic trough power plant, with relative error range of 1\% to about 5\%.

Al-Sulaiman~\cite{AlSulaiman2014} presented the exergy analysis of selected thermal power systems driven by PTSCs. The power pf the thermal power system is produced using either a steam Rankine cycle (SRC) or a combined cycle, in which the SRC is the topping cycle and an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is the bottoming cycle.

\nomenclature[C]{ORC}{Organic Rankine Cycle}

Hachicha~\cite{Hachicha2013} presented a detailed numerical heat transfer model based on the finite volume method for the parabolic trough collector.  This model is based on finite volume method and ray trace techniques and takes into account the finite size of the Sun.  The model is thoroughly validated with results from the literature and it shows a good agreement with experimental and analytical results.

Ashouri~\cite{Ashouri2015} coupled a small scale parabolic trough collector and a thermal storage tank along with an auxiliary heater to a Kalina cycle to study the performance of the system throughout the year, both thermodynamically and economically.

Guo~\cite{SuGuo2016} developed a nonlinear distribution parameter model to model the dynamic behaviors of direct steam generation parabolic trough collector loops under either full or partial solar irradiance disturbance.

Bader~\cite{Bader2015} developed a numerical model of a tubular vavity-receiver that uses air as the heat transfer fluid. Four different receiver configurations are considered, with smooth or V-corrugated absorber tube and single- or double-glazed aperture window. The different types of energy loss by the collector have been quantified, and the temperature distribution inside the receiver has been studied. The pumping power required to pump the HTF through the receiver has been determined for a 200 m long collector row.

Good~\cite{Good2015} proposed solar trough concentrators using air as heat transfer fluid at operating temperatures exceeding 600$^\circ$C. It consists of an array of helically coiled absorber tubes contained side-by-side within an insulated groove having a rectangular windowed opening. Secondary concentrating optics are incorporated to boost the geometric concentration ratio to 97$\times$.

Boukelia~\cite{Boukelia2016} investigated the feed-forward back-propagation learning algorithm with three different variants; Levenberge Marguardt (LM), Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG), and Pola-Ribiere Conjugate Gradient (PCG), used in artificial neural network (ANN) to find the best approach for prediction and techno-economic optimization of parabolic trough solar thermal power plant (PTSTPP) integrated with fuel backup system and thermal energy storage.

Kaloudis~\cite{Kaloudis2016} investigated a PTC system with nanofluid as the HTF in terms of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Syltherm 800 liquid oil was used as the HTF, and Al$_2$O$_3$ nanoparticles with the concentrations ranges from 0\% to 4\% was investigated. A boost up to 10\% on the collector efficiency was reported for Al$_2$O$_3$ concentration of 4\%.

Tan~\cite{Tan2014} proposed a two-stage photovoltaic thermal system based on solar trough concentration is proposed, in which the metal cavity heating stage is added on the basis of the PV/T stage, and thermal energy with higher temperature is output while electric energy is output. The experimental platform of the two-stage photovoltaic thermal system was established, with a 1.8 m$^2$ mirror PV/T stage and a 15 m$^2$ mirror heating stage, or a 1.8 m$^2$ mirror PV/T stage and a 30 m$^2$ mirror heating stage. The results showed that with single cycle, the long metal cavity heating stage would bring lower thermal efficiency, but temperature rise of the working medium is higher, up to 12.06$^\circ$C with only single cycle. With 30 min closed multiple cycles, the temperature of the working medium in the water tank was 62.8$^\circ$C, with an increase of 28.7$^\circ$C, and thermal energy with higher temperature could be output.

Al-Sulaiman~\cite{AlSulaiman2012} proposed a nvel system based on PTC and ORC for combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP). Performance assessment, including efficiency, net electrical power, and electrical to heating and cooling ratios, of the system shown that when CCHP is used, the efficiency increases significantly. This study reveals that the maximum electrical efficiency for the solar mode is 15\%, for the solar and storage mode is 7\%, and for the storage mode is 6.5\%. The maximum CCHP efficiency for the solar mode is 94\%, for the solar and storage mode is 47\%, and for the storage mode is 42\%.
\nomenclature[C]{CCHP}{Combined cooling, heating and power}

Lobon~\cite{Lobon2014} introduced a computational fluid dynamic simulation approach to predict the behavior of a solar steam generating system, which is located at the Plataforma Solar de Almeria, Spain. The CFD package STAR-CCM+ code has been used to implement an efficient multiphase model capable of simulating the dynamics of the multiphase fluid in parabolic-trough solar collectors. Numerical and experimental data are compared in a wide range of working conditions.
\nomenclature[C]{DSG}{Direct Steam Generation}

Xu~\cite{Xu2014} presented a method to compensate the end loss effect of PTC. An optical analysis on the end loss effect of PTC with horizontal north-south axis (PTC-HNSA) is performed and a five-meter PTC-HNSA experimental system was built. The increased thermal efficiency of the experimental system is measured, and the result that the experimental value (increased thermal efficiency) substantially agreed with the theoretical value (increased optical efficiency) is gained.

Liu~\cite{Liu2012} developed a mathematical model of PTC using the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) method. Numerical simulations are implemented to evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of the LSSVM method, where the sample data derived from the experiment and the simulation results of two solar collector systems with 30 m$^2$ and 600 m$^2$ solar fields, and the complicated relationship between the solar collector efficiency and the solar flux, the flow rate and the inlet temperature of the heat transfer fluid (HTF) is extracted.

\section{Solar Parabolic dish}\label{sec:pd}

One of the main goals of the BIOSTIRLING-4SKA project, funded by the European Commission, is the development of a hybrid Dish-Stirling system based on a hybrid solar-gas receiver, which has been designed by the Swedish company Cleanergy.~\cite{Blazquez2016}

Craig~\cite{Craig2016} proposed two types of cooking sections of the solar parabolic dish system: the spiral hot plate copper tube and the heat pipe plate. A conical cavity of copper tubes were put on the focus of the collectors to collect heat and the heat is stored inside an insulated tank which acts both as storage and cooking plate. The use of heat pipes to transfer heat between the oil storage and the cooking pot was compared to the use of a direct natural syphon principle which is achieved using copper tubes in spiral form like electric stove. An accurate theoretical analysis for the heat pipe cooker was achieved by solving the boiling and vaporization in the evaporator side and then balancing it with the condensation and liquid-vapour interaction in the condenser part while correct heat transfer, pressure and height balancing was calculated in the second experiment. The results show and compare the cooking time, boiling characteristics, overall utilisation efficiencies and necessary comparison between the two system and other existing systems.

Flux distribution of the receiver is simulated successfully by Mao~\cite{Mao2014} using MCRT method. The impacts of incident solar irradiation, aspect ratio (the ratio of the receiver height to the receiver diameter), and system error on the radiation flux of the receiver are investigated.

An experimental setup to investigate the thermal performance of a cylindrical cavity receiver for an SK-14 parabolic dish concentrator is presented in this technical note. The thermal performance is evaluated using energy and exergy analyses. The receiver exergy rates and efficiencies are found to be appreciably smaller than the receiver energy rates and efficiencies. The exergy factor parameter is also proposed for quantifying the thermal performance. The exergy factor is found to be high under conditions of high solar radiation and under high operating temperatures. The heat loss factor of the receiver is determined to be around 4.6 W/K. An optical efficiency of around 52% for parabolic dish system is determined under high solar radiation conditions. This experimental setup can be used as teaching tool for people with little or no knowledge about solar dish concentrators due its simplicity and the basic mathematical formulations applied. Different types of receivers and different types of deep focal region parabolic dishes can also be tested with the experimental setup.
