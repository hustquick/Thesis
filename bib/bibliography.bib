	Abstract = {A number of codes have been developed in order to optimize the heliostat field layout for solar power tower plants. These codes are intended to improve calculation accuracy as well as computational time. Of all the factors that need to be taken into account in these codes, shading and blocking calculations introduce significant complexity as they are computationally intensive. In this paper, a new and simple method is proposed to identify the heliostats with the greatest potential for shadowing and blocking a heliostat. Using the new method, the computational time is considerably reduced as unnecessary calculations are avoided. The Sassi method [1] is then used to calculate the shading and blocking efficiency. The results are compared with the literature and good agreement is obtained. As a case study, the paper also investigates optimization of a 50MWth heliostat field layout for Dagget, California. Yearly insolation weighted efficiency is selected as the objective function while two parameters of the prophylaxis pattern [2], which define the shape of the field layout, are the design variables. The acceptance angle of the cavity receiver and distance between the adjacent heliostats are the physical constraints which are included in the optimization. The optimization algorithm is explained in detail and the optimal field layout is presented. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	Abstract = {The aim of this work was to propose a novel system combines both solar chimney and thermo siphon solar tower systems. To this end, theoretical study to the proposed system was conducted. In this new system, the solar tower was installed at the exit of the solar chimney. The results of the theoretical study showed that, the new system generates more power compared with the conventional system. It was found that the maximum power extracted from the new system was about two times that obtained from the conventional system at the same height, for the specified range studied in this work. In addition, it was found that the new system has higher overall efficiency and generates higher speeds of air at the chimney inlet. This increase in both maximum power and air speed at the chimney inlet from the new system is enhanced with the rise in solar irradiance, radius of collector, and ratio of solar tower height to solar chimney height. Moreover, the results indicated that there is a certain ratio between solar tower length and width at which the maximum extracted mechanical power reached a maximum value for the specified parameters of solar irradiance, collector radius, height of chimney, and height of solar tower.

@article{Franchini2013,
	Abstract = {Abstract Simulations were carried out to predict the performance of a Solar Rankine Cycle (SRC) and an Integrated Solar Combined Cycle (ISCC) when combined with two different solar field configurations based on parabolic trough and power tower systems. For the selected cases, yearly plant performance was computed under real operating conditions on a one hour basis. A computing procedure was developed by integrating two commercial softwares with in-house computer code. Thermodynamic performance was featured for every plant configuration both at nominal and part load conditions. A single reheat regenerative Rankine cycle was chosen for the \{SRC\} plant whereas a commercial gas turbine, i.e. Siemens SGT-800, with a dual pressure heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) was assumed for the \{ISCC\} plant. As far as the heat transfer fluid (HTF) is concerned, molten salt was chosen to transfer heat to the water loop in the SRC. Synthetic oil was considered in the \{ISCC\} plant. Plants were assumed to be located in a Southern Spain site. The comparative analysis was mainly focused on the influence of \{CSP\} technology on global solar energy conversion efficiency of both \{SRC\} and \{ISCC\} plants. Special attention was devoted to assess trough collectors (PTCs) against the solar tower (ST) system in terms of intercepted radiation and thermal power sent to the power block. The \{ISCC\} coupled with a \{ST\} was found to assure the highest annual solar-to-electric efficiency of 21.8%. This is the result of both higher collection efficiency of \{ST\} compared to \{PTCs\} and higher conversion efficiency of solar energy introduced into the combined cycle, as compared to SRC. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Heat loss is an important factor in predicting the performance of solar receiver of concentrated solar power (CSP) systems. This study presents a numerical simulation calculating convection and radiation heat losses from four different receiver shapes including external and cavity type receivers with different opening ratios (ratio of cavity aperture area to receiver area). The simulation was carried out using Fluent \{CFD\} (computational fluid dynamics) software considering three different receiver temperatures (600, 750, and 900 $\,^{\circ}$C), three wind velocities (1, 5, and 10 m/s), and two wind directions (head-on and side-on). The simulation results were then used for deriving a simplified correlation model which gives the fraction of convection heat loss by a function of opening ratio, receiver temperature, and wind velocity. The calculated fraction can be easily converted to convection heat loss, total heat loss, or receiver efficiency once the radiation heat loss is estimated by any applicable prediction model. Calculated heat loses by the proposed simple correlation model showed good agreements with the simulation results with 11.4% and 5.9% average absolute deviations for convection heat loss and total heat loss, respectively. Validation of the model with experimental data was also carried out using test results available from three central receiver systems (Martin Marietta, Solar One and Solar Two). },

	Abstract = {A novel modeling tool for calculation of central receiver concentrated flux distributions is presented, which takes into account drift effects. This tool is based on a drift model that includes different geometrical error sources in a rigorous manner and on a simple analytic approximation for the individual flux distribution of a heliostat. The model is applied to a group of heliostats of a real field to obtain the resulting flux distribution and its variation along the day. The distributions differ strongly from those obtained assuming the ideal case without drift or a case with a Gaussian tracking error function. The time evolution of peak flux is also calculated to demonstrate the capabilities of the model. The evolution of this parameter also shows strong differences in comparison to the case without drift.},

	Abstract = {A method for optimizing a central receiver solar thermal electric power plant is studied. We parametrize the plant design as a function of eleven design variables and reduce the problem of finding optimal designs to the numerical problem of finding the minimum of a function of several variables. This minimization problem is attacked with different algorithms both local and global in nature. We find that all algorithms find the same minimum of the objective function. The performance of each of the algorithms and the resulting designs are studied for two typical cases. We describe a method to evaluate the impact of design variables in the plant performance. This method will tell us what variables are key to the optimal plant design and which ones are less important. This information can be used to further improve the plant design and to accelerate the optimization procedure. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	Abstract = {A new method for the design of the heliostat field layout for solar tower power plant is proposed. In the new method, the heliostat boundary is constrained by the receiver geometrical aperture and the efficiency factor which is the product of the annual cosine efficiency and the annual atmospheric transmission efficiency of heliostat. With the new method, the annual interception efficiency does not need to be calculated when places the heliostats, therefore the total time of design and optimization is saved significantly. Based on the new method, a new code for heliostat field layout design (HFLD) has been developed and a new heliostat field layout for the PS10 plant at the PS10 location has been designed by using the new code. Compared with current PS10 layout, the new designed heliostats have the same optical efficiency but with a faster response speed. In addition, to evaluate the feasibility of crops growth on the field land under heliostats, a new calculation method for the annual sunshine duration on the land surface is proposed as well. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

With the new method, the heliostat can be placed with a higher efficiency and a faster response speed of the design and optimization can be obtained. A new module for the analysis of the aspherical heliostat is created in the new code. A new toroidal heliostat field is designed and analyzed by using the new code. Compared with the spherical heliostat, the solar image radius of the field is reduced by about 30{\%} by using the toroidal heliostat if the mirror shape and the tracking are ideal.

	Abstract = { AbstractThis paper presents a preliminary design method based on dynamic similarity and quasistatic simulation. The proposal improves methods based on Beale and West correlations and provides the engine speeds corresponding to the maximum indicated powers and the achievement of indicated power maps. The dimensionless factor of indicated power losses provides a new viewpoint for engine analysis and design. In support of the method, experimental GPU-3 test results have been reanalysed, proving the accuracy of maximum indicated power predictions and providing values of the dimensionless factor of indicated power losses. Scaling factors corresponding to strict dynamic similarity are supplied for several typical cases. Similarity relaxation criteria are also recommended to be used when strict dynamic similarity leads to inadequate specifications for the derivative. Some numerical examples illustrate the method. },

	Abstract = {A technique for calculating the efficiency and power of Stirling machines is presented. This technique is based on the First Law of Thermodynamics for processes with finite speed and the Direct Method for closed systems. In order to apply the Direct Method to Stirling Cycles, a new and novel PV/Px diagram is presented that shows the effects of pressure losses due to friction, finite speed and throttling processes in the regenerator of the Stirling engine. The method used for the analysis of this irreversible cycle with finite speed involves the direct integration of equations based on the first law for processes with finite speed to obtain the cycle efficiency and power directly. This technique is termed the Direct Method. The results predicted by this analysis are in good agreement with the actual engine performance data of 12 different Stirling engines, over a range of output from economy to maximum power. This provides a solid verification that this analysis, based on the Direct Method, can accurately predict actual Stirling engine performance, particularly with regard to efficiency and output power. In addition to the powerful predictive capabilities of the Direct Method, the new PV/Px diagram for the Stirling cycle is both an effective and an intuitive tool for explaining the operation and design of Stirling machines.

An empircical model of mechanical power losses is proposed to complete the indicated power model previously introduced by Prieto and co-workers. That approach is mainly based on the characteristic Stirling number and allows the performance of known prototypes to be analysed from the viewpoint of indicated power, brake power and mechanical efficiency. After showing that similarity criteria can be extended to brake power performance, scaling factors have been derived for typical scaling cases. Some examples show that quasi-static simulation and scaling techniques may be combined to support preliminary design procedures. },

The system uses a cavity receiver containing 20 reactor tubes filled with iron based catalyst material, which collects the radiation from a 20 m2 dish solar concentrator. Reliable operation over a range of conditions including cloud transients has been demonstrated. Parallel theoretical investigations have established that maximising the potential for electrical power production from ammonia synthesis reactors, can largely be achieved through appropriate choice of average operating temperature in standard reactors. The possibility of operating the ammonia based system using trough concentrators has also been investigated theoretically, and the preliminary results indicate encouraging energy storage efficiencies in the region of 53\%. },

	Abstract = {One of the most novel applications of the Stirling cycle is in the free piston configuration that was initially designed by W. Beale. In free piston Stirling engines (FPSEs), there are no mechanical linkages coupling the pistons or displacers, the motions of the reciprocating components follow the working gas pressure variations. Fillipo de Monte and G. Benvenuto have recently proposed a linearization technique of the dynamic balance equations. The aim of this paper is to predict the thermodynamic conditions for stable operation of \{FPSEs\} and their modeling. The equations of the angular velocity are solved analytically in terms of the working gas mass and the displacer--piston phase angle of the machine. Using the criterion of stable engine cyclic steady operation, a mathematically rigorous form is obtained for the main parameters of the engine. Furthermore, for simplicity reasons, thermodynamic magnitudes are obtained using the Schmidt analysis (isothermal model). },

	Abstract = {The performance of Stirling engines meets the demands of the efficient use of energy and environmental security and therefore they are the subject of much current interest. Hence, the development and investigation of Stirling engine have come to the attention of many scientific institutes and commercial companies. The Stirling engine is both practically and theoretically a significant device, its practical virtue is simple, reliable and safe which was recognized for a full century following its invention by Robert Stirling in 1816. The engine operates on a closed thermodynamic cycle, which is reversible. Today Stirling cycle-based systems are in commercial use as a heat pump, cryogenic refrigeration and air liquefaction. As a prime mover, Stirling cycles remain the subject of research and development efforts. The objective of this paper is to provide fundamental information and present a detailed review of the past efforts taken for the development of the Stirling cycle engine and techniques used for engine analysis. A number of attempts have been made by researches to build and improve the performance of Stirling engines. It is seen that for successful operation of engine system with good efficiency a careful design of heat exchangers, proper selection of drive mechanism and engine configuration is essential. The study indicates that a Stirling cycle engine working with relatively low temperature with air of helium as working fluid is potentially attractive engines of the future, especially solar-powered low-temperature differential Stirling engines with vertical, double acting, and gamma configuration. },

When the optimal design parameters are introduced in the model, the engine efficiency increases from 39% to 51%; the engine power is enhanced by approximately 20%, whereas the engine average pressure increases slightly. },

	Abstract = {A model of an irreversible cycle of the Stirling heat engine, using air as the working substance, has been established. Several irreversibilities due to the non-adiabatic regenerator dead volumes of hot space, cold space, and regenerator that the regenerator effective temperature is an arithmetic mean of the heater and cooler temperature. In addition, the general irreversibilities of the non-quasistatic cycle are taken into account. Numerical simulation is performed and the effects of the regenerator effectiveness and dead volumes are studied. Some fundamental optimal relations and general performance characteristic curves of the cycle are obtained. The results from this study indicate that the engine net work is affected by the cycle irreversibilities, while the heat input and engine efficiency are affected by both the regenerator effectiveness and dead volumes. It is concluded that the system operating temperature and the overall system efficiency depend on the internal irreversibility of the heat engine. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	Abstract = {In order to study further the promising free piston Stirling engine architecture, there is a need of an analytical thermodynamic model which could be used in a dynamical analysis for preliminary design. To aim at more realistic values, the models have to take into account the heat losses and irreversibilities on the engine. An analytical model which encompasses the critical flaws of the regenerator and furthermore the heat exchangers effectivenesses has been developed. This model has been validated using the whole range of the experimental data available from the General Motor GPU-3 Stirling engine prototype.

	Abstract = {The Stirling cycle engine is gaining increasing attention in the current energy market as a clean, quiet and versatile prime mover for use in such situations as solar thermal generation, micro-cogeneration and other micro-distributed generation situations. A theoretical Stirling cycle engine model is developed. Using a theoretical decoupled engine configuration in which working space swept volume, volume variation, phase angle and dead space ratio are controlled via a black-box electronic controller, a model is developed that is to be used as a tool for analysis of the ideal Stirling cycle engine and the limits on its real-world realisation. The theoretical configuration approximates the five-space configuration common in Stirling cycle analysis. It comprises two working spaces and three heat exchangers: hot side, cold side and the regenerator between. The kinematic crank mechanism is replaced by electronically controlled motor/generator units, with one motor/generator controlling each of the working pistons. The use of stop valves permits the flow and non-flow processes inherent in the ideal cycle to be realised. The engine configuration considered here is not intended as a viable prime mover but rather a tool for study of the limitations of the cycle. },

	Abstract = {The study of free piston Stirling engine (FPSE) requires both accurate thermodynamic and dynamic modelling to predict its performances. The steady state behaviour of the engine partly relies on non linear dissipative phenomena such as pressure drop loss within heat exchangers which is dependant on the temperature within the associated components. An analytical thermodynamic model which encompasses the effectiveness and the flaws of the heat exchangers and the regenerator has been previously developed and validated. A semi-analytical dynamic model of \{FPSE\} is developed and presented in this paper. The thermodynamic model is used to define the thermal variables that are used in the dynamic model which evaluates the kinematic results. Thus, a coupled iterative strategy has been used to perform a global simulation. The global modelling approach has been validated using the experimental data available from the \{NASA\} RE-1000 Stirling engine prototype. The resulting coupled thermodynamic--dynamic model using a standardized description of the engine allows efficient and realistic preliminary design of FPSE. },

	Abstract = {A mathematical model for the overall thermal efficiency of the solar-powered high temperature differential dish-Stirling engine with finite-rate heat transfer, regenerative heat losses, conductive thermal bridging losses and finite regeneration processes time is developed. The model takes into consideration the effect of the absorber temperature and the concentrating ratio on the thermal efficiency; radiation and convection heat transfer between the absorber and the working fluid as well as convection heat transfer between the heat sink and the working fluid. The results show that the optimized absorber temperature and concentrating ratio are at about 1100 K and 1300, respectively. The thermal efficiency at optimized condition is about 34\%, which is not far away from the corresponding Carnot efficiency at about 50\%. Hence, the present analysis provides a new theoretical guidance for designing dish collectors and operating the Stirling heat engine system. },

	Abstract = {This paper provides a theoretical investigation on the thermodynamic analysis of a Stirling engine with linear and sinusoidal variations of the volume. The regenerator in a Stirling engine is an internal heat exchanger allowing to reach high efficiency. We used an isothermal model to analyse the net work and the heat stored in the regenerator during a complete cycle. We show that the engine efficiency with perfect regeneration doesn't depend on the regenerator dead volume but this dead volume strongly amplifies the imperfect regeneration effect. An analytical expression to estimate the improvement due to the regenerator has been proposed including the combined effects of dead volume and imperfect regeneration. This could be used at the very preliminary stage of the engine design process. },

	Abstract = {Abstract A solar-powered high temperature differential Stirling engine was considered for optimization using multiple criteria. A thermal model was developed so that the output power and thermal efficiency of the solar Stirling system with finite rate of heat transfer, regenerative heat loss, conductive thermal bridging loss, finite regeneration process time and imperfect performance of the dish collector could be obtained. The output power and overall thermal efficiency were considered for simultaneous maximization. Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) based on the NSGA-II algorithm were employed while the solar absorber temperature and the highest and lowest temperatures of the working fluid were considered the decision variables. The Pareto optimal frontier was obtained and a final optimal solution was also selected using various decision-making methods including the fuzzy Bellman--Zadeh, \{LINMAP\} and TOPSIS. It was found that multi-objective optimization could yield results with a relatively low deviation from the ideal solution in comparison to the conventional single objective approach. Furthermore, it was shown that, if the weight of thermal efficiency as one of the objective functions is considered to be greater than weight of the power objective, lower absorber temperature and low temperature ratio should be considered in the design of the Stirling engine. },

A new modelling method and homemade unified code with the Monte Carlo Ray-Trace (MCRT) method for the \{CSCs\} are presented firstly. The details of the new designing method and homemade unified code with \{MCRT\} for numerical investigations on solar concentrating and collecting characteristics of the \{CSCs\} are introduced. Three coordinate systems are used in the \{MCRT\} program and can be totally independent from each other. Solar radiation in participating medium and/or non-participating medium can be taken into account simultaneously or dividedly in the simulation. The criteria of data processing and method/code checking are also proposed in detail. Finally the proposed method and code are applied to simulate and analyze the involuted photo-thermal conversion processes in three typical CSCs. The results show that the proposed method and model are reliable to simulate various types of CSCs. },

	Abstract = {Abstract In this paper, Monte Carlo Ray Tracing (MCRT) and Finite Volume Method (FVM) coupling method is adopted to solve the radiation, conduction and convection coupled heat transfer problems of porous media receiver with multi-dish collector. The MCRT method is used to obtain the concentrated heat flux distribution on the fluid inlet surface of porous media receiver. The local thermal non-equilibrium (LTNE) model with concentrated solar irradiation on the fluid inlet surface is used for energy equations. FVM software FLUENT with User Defined Functions (UDFs) is used to solve the fluid phase and solid phase heat transfer problems. The effects of solar irradiance, air inlet velocity, average particle diameter, receiver radius and air properties on the temperature distribution are investigated. },

A mathematical model for the thermal analysis of the solar-powered low temperature Stirling engine with heat transfer is developed using Matlab program. The model takes into consideration the effect of the absorber temperature on the thermal analysis like as radiation and convection heat transfer between the absorber and the working fluid as well as radiation and convection heat transfer between the lower temperature plate and the working fluid. Hence, the present analysis provides a theoretical guidance for designing and operating of the solar-powered low temperature Stirling engine system, as well as estimating output power from the solar Stirling engine using Matlab program. This study attempts to demonstrate the potential of the low temperature Stirling engine as an option for the prime movers for Photovoltaic tracking systems. The heat source temperature is 40--60 $\,^{\circ}$C as the temperature available from the sun directly. },

	Abstract = {Abstract An inverse design method is developed in order to quickly find possible cavity receiver designs with relative uniform cavity wall surface temperature for a solar dish cavity receiver. In this design method, a heat transfer model of the absorber wall is used for analyzing the main heat transfer process between the cavity wall outer surface, the inner surface and the working fluid. Furthermore, a ray-tracing model based on the parameters of a real dish is utilized for obtaining the solar radiative boundary conditions for the heat transfer model. Impinging jet cooling technology is introduced due to its high heat transfer coefficient in the stagnation area, which can be used for cooling the peak flux on the cavity wall. After applying a well-designed impinging system, the temperature peak on the peak flux region in traditional receiver designs can be mitigated without introducing any over pressure drop problem. },

	Abstract = {Abstract The solar receiver is one of the key components of hybrid solar micro gas-turbine systems, which would seem to present a number of advantages when compared with Stirling engine based systems and photovoltaic panels. In this study a solar receiver meeting the specific requirements for integration into a small-scale (10 kWel) dish-mounted hybrid solar micro gas-turbine system has been designed with a special focus on the trade-offs between efficiency, pressure drop, material utilization and economic design. A situation analysis, performed using a multi-objective optimizer, has shown that a pressurized configuration, where the solar receiver is placed before the turbine, is superior to an atmospheric configuration with the solar receiver placed after the turbine. Based on these initial design results, coupled CFD/FEM simulations have been performed, allowing detailed analysis of the designs under the expected operating conditions. The results show that the use of volumetric solar receivers to provide heat input to micro gas-turbine based solar dish systems appears to be a promising solution; with material temperatures and material stresses well below permissible limits. },

@article{Araoz2015,
	Abstract = {Abstract The Stirling engine is a closed-cycle regenerative system that presents good theoretical properties. These include a high thermodynamic efficiency, low emissions levels thanks to a controlled external heat source, and multi-fuel capability among others. However, the performance of actual prototypes largely differs from the mentioned theoretical potential. Actual engine prototypes present low electrical power outputs and high energy losses. These are mainly attributed to the complex interaction between the different components of the engine, and the challenging heat transfer and fluid dynamics requirements. Furthermore, the integration of the engine into decentralized energy systems such as the Combined Heat and Power systems (CHP) entails additional complications. These has increased the need for engineering tools that could assess design improvements, considering a broader range of parameters that would influence the engine performance when integrated within overall systems. Following this trend, the current work aimed to implement an analysis that could integrate the thermodynamics, and the thermal and mechanical interactions that influence the performance of kinematic Stirling engines. In particular for their use in Combined Heat and Power systems. The mentioned analysis was applied for the study of an engine prototype that presented very low experimental performance. The numerical methodology was selected for the identification of possible causes that limited the performance. This analysis is based on a second order Stirling engine model that was previously developed and validated. The simulation allowed to evaluate the effect that different design and operational parameters have on the engine performance, and consequently different performance curves were obtained. These curves allowed to identify ranges for the charged pressure, temperature ratio, heat exchangers dimensions, crank phase angle and crank mechanical effectiveness, where the engine performance was improved. In addition, the curves also permitted to recognise ranges were the design parameters could drastically reduce the brake power and efficiency. The results also showed that the design of the engine is affected by the conditions imposed by the \{CHP\} interactions, and that the engine could reach a brake power closer to 832 W with a corresponding brake efficiency of 26% when the adequate design parameters were considered. On the other hand, the performance could also be very low; as the reported in experimental tests, with brake power measurements ranging 52--120 W. },

	Abstract = {Abstract A three phase free piston type double acting Stirling engine model is proposed and validated using experimental results. The modeling strategy is based on a combination of two sub-models: a global thermal model of the engine to deal with heat sources coupling and a detailed equivalent electrical network model which accounts for the gas and mechanical dynamic physics of the engine. Derived features, such as the amplitude, the frequency, the compression and the expansion powers are then finally obtained. The model is experimentally validated with a prototype of a free piston Stirling engine. Mean error on the amplitude, the frequency, the internal temperatures and the compression and expansion powers is 9\%, so the model is considered accurate enough to predict performances. For optimization purpose, a numerical analysis is performed selecting the three following critical parameters: (i) dead volume of the chambers, (ii) natural frequency of the mechanical oscillators and (iii) thermal conduction between hot and cold sides. Smaller dead volume, large oscillating mass and high insulation are to be sought for maximizing the performances. With a pressurization of 3 bar, a theoretical useful power of 18 W can be reach with conservative modification of the existing prototype. Moreover, energy and exergy analyses highlight the main losses in the system: thermal leakage, gas spring hysteresis as well as heat transfer and viscous dissipation in the heat exchangers. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Thermal models for the simulation of Stirling engines need to have greater accuracy along with simple and low-cost calculation. In this regard, a new closed-form thermal model was presented for the thermal simulation of Stirling engines. The new model called \{PFST\} (polytropic-finite speed thermodynamics) was developed based on the combination of polytropic analysis of expansion/compression processes and the concept of finite speed thermodynamics (FST). Therefore, compression/expansion works of compression/expansion processes and transferred heat into the heater of Stirling engines were determined based on polytropic analysis, instead of isothermal processes of the ideal Stirling cycle. The calculated work of polytropic processes was corrected to include the effects of internal irreversibilities including pressure throttling in heat exchangers, mechanical friction, and finite motion of the pistons. Output power and thermal efficiency of Stirling engines were calculated as functions of various engine parameters. The developed \{PFST\} model was implemented on a prototype Stirling engine, called GPU-3 engine, and the obtained results were compared with those of other closed-form and numerical models as well as experimental data. It was found that the new closed-form model, in addition to its simple and low-cost calculation, had the same order of accuracy as recently developed numerical models. },

During the test, the concentrated solar flux is approximately 1000 kW/m2 at aperture. The solar irradiance is almost unchanged (650 W/m2) for continuous two hours in the afternoon, which is used to analyze the energy and exergy performance of the solar receiver. Experimental results show that, the efficiency of the solar receiver is normally above 70% with the highest efficiency of 82%, whereas at steady state, the efficiency is maintained at around 80%. A very low value of the heat loss factor (0.02 kW/K) could be achieved during the current steady state operating conditions. The highest value of the exergy rate is around 8.8 kW, whereas the maximum energy rate can reach 21.3 kW. In addition, the highest exergy efficiency is approximately 28%, and the highest energy efficiency is around 82%. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Popular thermodynamic analyses including finite time thermodynamic analysis was lately developed based upon external irreversibilities while internal irreversibilities such as friction, pressure drop and entropy generation were not considered. The aforementioned disadvantage reduces the reliability of the finite time thermodynamic analysis in the design of an accurate Stirling engine model. Consequently, the finite time thermodynamic analysis could not sufficiently satisfy researchers for implementing in design and optimization issues. In this study, finite speed thermodynamic analysis was employed instead of finite time thermodynamic analysis for studying Stirling heat engine. The finite speed thermodynamic analysis approach is based on the first law of thermodynamics for a closed system with finite speed and the direct method. The effects of heat source temperature, regenerating effectiveness, volumetric ratio, piston stroke as well as rotational speed are included in the analysis. Moreover, maximum output power in optimal rotational speed was calculated while pressure losses in the Stirling engine were systematically considered. The result reveals the accuracy and the reliability of the finite speed thermodynamic method in thermodynamic analysis of Stirling heat engine. The outcomes can help researchers in the design of an appropriate and efficient Stirling engine. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) can be used as an efficient low cost energy conversion system to produce different types of energy, such as electricity, through the use of concentrated parabolic dish systems. In the study of CSP, most of the researchers focus on the heat losses and their relationships to the receivers' geometries. The present study concentrates on the optical efficiency as well as the flux distribution of the three different geometries: cylindrical, conical and spherical, of a cavity receiver, with the objective of analysing their behaviour using an advanced ray tracing method. The results of this study have shown that there is a connection between the flux distribution on the internal surfaces of the cavities and their optical efficiency. Moreover, the conical shape receiver received, as well as absorbed, a higher amount of reflected flux energy than the other shapes. The optical efficiency reached 75.3\%, 70.1\% and 71.5\% for the conical, spherical and cylindrical shapes respectively at surface absorptivity of 85\%. Also, the focal point location depends on the shape of the cavity receiver and its absorptivity. Thereby, there is an optimum distance for each design depending on these two factors. The results of the simulated work are validated using the experimental work found in the literature. },

	Abstract = {Abstract This study presents a dynamic model of a gamma-type Stirling engine and examines variations of the crank rotational speed against time (Dynamic response). Kinematic relations of the engine linkages were determined and Lagrange formulations were formed for rigid body dynamics. Working gas pressures on each surface of the rigid bodies were calculated over time using a third order thermodynamic analysis code. A test setup was established for measuring dynamic and thermodynamic state variables of ST500engine. First, experiment data was used to validate the thermodynamic code results. Then the dynamic formulations combined with the thermodynamic code were simultaneously solved and the result is compared to \{ST500\} dynamic response. Finally, using the whole dynamic model, new aspects of Stirling engine behavior were investigated. The dynamic--thermodynamic combination of the model gives the opportunity to instantly calculate a precise open-loop response, which is the essential part of designing proper load controllers for inherently unstable Stirling engines. },

@article{Jia2016,
	Abstract = {Abstract This paper presents a linearization of the dynamic equation for a free-piston engine generator (FPEG), and simplifies it to a one-degree forced vibration system with viscous damping. The analogy between a mass-spring damper and a \{FPEG\} system is expressed, and the solution to the vibration system is solved. The model was successfully validated with respect to experimental data obtained from a prototype. The simulated piston displacement during steady operation showed similar trends with the test results and the error of the displacement amplitude was controlled within 3%. The state-space equations and the transfer function of the system are obtain using the fast response numerical model. An example of model application in the real \{FEPG\} control system was provided. Compared to the previous numerical model with differential approaches, the solving time of the proposed fast response model can be significantly reduced. The simplicity and flexibility of the proposed model make it feasible to be implemented to several computing software, i . e . Matlab, AMESim, Labview, Dymola et al. It can be easily implemented to real-time Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulation model for the future piston dynamic control system development. In addition, since it reveals how an \{FPEG\} operates in a resonant principle, the model is useful for parameter selection in the \{FPEG\} design process. },

	Abstract = {Abstract In this paper, a solar energy powered gamma type \{SE\} has been optimized using Finite Physical Dimensions Thermodynamics (FPDT) method by multi-objective criteria. Genetic algorithm was used to get the Pareto frontier, and optimum points were obtained using the decision making methods of \{LINMAP\} and TOPSIS. The optimization results have been compared with those obtained using the ecological method. It was shown that the multi-objective optimization in this paper has a better balance among the optimizing criteria (maximum mechanical power, maximum thermal efficiency and minimum entropy generation flow). The effects of the hot source temperature and the total thermal conductance of the engine on the Pareto frontier have been also studied. This sensibility study shows that an increase in the hot reservoir temperature can increase the output mechanical power, the thermal efficiency of the engine, but also the entropy generation rate. In addition to this, an increase of the total thermal conductance of the engine can strongly increase the output mechanical power and only slightly increase the thermal efficiency. These results allow us to improve the engine performance after some modifications as geometrical dimensions (diameter, stroke, heat exchange surface, etc.) and physical parameters (temperature, thermal conductivity). },

	Abstract = {Abstract In this study, a solar dish collector is considered with a rectangular cavity receiver. The investigated parameters were included the receiver aperture area (a2), receiver tube diameter, cavity depth, inlet temperature and mass flow rate through the receiver. This cavity receiver is used as the heat source of the organic Rankine cycle (ORC). The \{ORC\} system is considered with \{R141b\} as the working fluid at the saturated condition. The main objective is the calculation of the optimum parameters for attaining the maximum overall thermal efficiency of the system. With the help of the receiver modeling techniques, the optimum aspect ratios of 54.25, 40.69, 32.56, 23.25 and 18.09 are identified for five cavity depths of 0.5a, 0.75a, 1a, 1.5a, and 2a where the accompanying optical efficiencies are 89\%, 92\%, 94\%, 96\% and 96\%, respectively. It is concluded that for increasing the collector efficiency and overall thermal efficiency, a higher mass flow rate, and a lower inlet thermal oil inlet temperature are required. Also the results show that the optimum characteristic of the cavity for achieving highest collector efficiency and the highest overall thermal efficiency includes smaller tube diameter, lower inlet temperature of the working fluid, and the cavity depth of 1a. },

@article{Luo2016,
	Abstract = {Abstract Stirling engine has become preferable for high attention towards the use of alternate renewable energy resources like biomass and solar energy. Stirling engine is the main component of dish Stirling system in thermal power generation sector. Stirling engine is an externally heating engine, which theoretical efficiency is as high as Carnot cycle's, but actual ones are always far below compared with the Carnot efficiency. A number of studies have been done on multi-objective optimization to improve the design of Stirling engine. In the current study, a multi-objective optimization method, which is a combination of multiple optimization algorithms including differential evolution, genetic algorithm and adaptive simulated annealing, was proposed. This method is an attempt to generalize and improve the robustness and diversity with above three kinds of population based meta-heuristic optimization techniques. The analogous interpreter was linked and interchanged to find the best global optimal solution for Stirling engine performance optimization. It decreases the chance of convergence at a local minimum by powering from the fact that these three algorithms run parallel and members from each population and technique are swapped. The optimization considers five decision variables, including engine frequency, mean effective pressure, temperature of heating source, number of wires in regenerator matrix, and the wire diameter of regenerator, as multiple objectives. The Pareto optimal frontier was obtained and a final optimal solution was also selected by using various multi-criteria decision making methods including techniques for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution and Simple Additive Weighting. The multi-objective optimization indicated a way for GPU-3 Stirling engine to obtain an output power of more than 3 kW and an increase by 5\% in thermal efficiency with significant decrease in power loss due to flow resistance. },

@article{Ni2016,
	Abstract = {Abstract A key issue in designing and optimizing Stirling engines is to build a precise thermodynamic model to predict the output power, thermal efficiency, and detailed performance properties and provide useful information for further improvement. In this study, a thermodynamic model called Improved Simple Analytical Model (ISAM) was proposed, carefully considering heat and power losses in Stirling engines. A 100 W β -type Stirling engine was built and tested with helium and nitrogen when pressure and rotary speed ranging from 1.6 \{MPa\} to 3 \{MPa\} and 260 r/min to 1380 r/min, respectively. Experimental information on performance, such as \{PV\} diagrams and temperatures of the heater and cooler, was much detailed. Increasing rotary speed brings a ``thin'' \{PV\} diagram because it made compression and expansion processes become more imperfect, indicating heat transfer enhancement was necessary for compression and expansion chamber in a high speed Stirling engine. Shaft power reached the maximum value of 30.1 W for helium and 21.0 W for nitrogen at rotary speeds of 1000 r/min and 650 r/min, respectively. Improving the mean pressure of gas increased the indicated power, cycle efficiency, shaft power, and electrical power. The maximum indicated power and cycle efficiency were 165 W and 16.5% for helium and 139 W and 12.2% for nitrogen in the same working conditions of 2.96 \{MPa\} and 1120 r/min. The \{ISAM\} agrees well with the experimental data with a deviation of 4.3--13.4% for helium and 1--7.1% for nitrogen. Analysis of energy losses with \{ISAM\} indicated that helium had larger shuttle and seal leakage losses and smaller flow resistance and regenerator heat transfer losses than nitrogen under the same working conditions. Flow resistance and regenerator heat transfer losses, which increased much more rapidly than seal leakage or shuttle heat losses with the increase in rotary speed and pressure, played an important role and resulted in different performances with the two working gases. This study provides comprehensive understanding of the influence mechanism of rotary speed, pressure and working gas in the view of heat/power losses for Stirling engine performance, and recommends that more work (e.g., mechanisms of heat and power losses and \{PV\} diagrams) should be performed to improve the precision of second-order models. },

	Abstract = {Abstract The optical performance of a solar dish concentrator/cavity receiver system based on the Monte Carlo Ray Tracing Method (MCRTM) was carried out under ideal optics. The study was precipitated by a need to analyze the influence of geometrical parameters and surface properties of a cavity receiver systematically and to understand the mechanism of the optical performance under various parameters. These include diameter ratio (the ratio of aperture diameter to absorber outer diameter), height ratio (the ratio of absorber height to absorber outer diameter) and sidewall absorptivity of cavity receiver. In addition, an optical efficiency of the absorber is defined and presented for the first time. The analysis indicates that the optical efficiency increases and then decreases with higher height ratio, while optical efficiency curves are reduced monotonically with diameter ratio. Simultaneously, the effects of the height and diameter ratios on optical efficiency are both influenced by sidewall absorptivity. Based on the results, a correlation of optical efficiency was further developed to quantify the influences of these factors. The maximum optical efficiency and its corresponding optimal height ratio from both simulation and correlation are presented and obtain reasonable agreement. The optimized selection of height ratio along with diameter ratio are suggested using this result. The height ratio is found to be a pure controlling parameter of the radiation flux distribution. },

This paper addresses the modelling and simulation of a solar powered Stirling engine system with parabolic dish and electric generator aiming to determine its energy production and efficiency. The model includes the solar radiation concentration system, the heat transfer in the thermal receiver, the thermal cycle and the mechanical and electric energy conversion. The thermodynamic and energy transfer processes in the engine are modelled in detail, including all the main processes occurring in the compression, expansion and regenerator spaces. Starting from a particular configuration, an optimization of the concentration factor is also carried out and the results for both the transient and steady state regimes are presented. It was found that using a directly illuminated thermal receiver without cavity the engine efficiency is close to 23.8% corresponding to a global efficiency of 10.4%. The components to be optimized are identified in order to increase the global efficiency of the system and the trade-off between system complexity and efficiency is discussed. },

A heat transfer fluid circulates through a metal tube (receiver) with an external selective surface that absorbs solar radiation reflected from the mirror surfaces of the PTC. In order to reduce the heat losses, the receiver is covered by an envelope and the enclosure is usually kept under vacuum pressure. The heat transfer and optical analysis of the \{PTC\} is essential to optimize and understand its performance under different operating conditions. In this paper a detailed one dimensional numerical heat transfer analysis of a \{PTC\} is performed. The receiver and envelope were divided into several segments and mass and energy balance were applied in each segment. Improvements either in the heat transfer correlations or radiative heat transfer analysis are presented as well. The partial differential equations were discretized and the nonlinear algebraic equations were solved simultaneously. Finally, to validate the numerical results, the model was compared with experimental data obtained from Sandia National Laboratory (SNL) and other one dimensional heat transfer models. Our results showed a better agreement with experimental data compared to other models. },

	Abstract = {Abstract The influences of some parameters on the performance of parabolic trough solar receiver are investigated in the present work. When the mass flow rate of working fluid, ambient temperature and solar incident angle increase, the heat losses of solar receiver decrease. The exergy losses of solar receiver increase as the inlet temperature of working fluid, wind velocity, and the inner diameter of glass cover increase. The convective heat loss of glass cover predominates in the heat losses of solar receiver based on thermal efficiency, but the exergy lost from absorber ends takes the largest proportion. The optical heat loss of solar collector is far more than the heat losses of solar receiver, especially in the larger solar incident angle. There exists an optimal mass flow rate of working fluid for exergy efficiency, and the thermal efficiency and exergy efficiency have opposite changing tendencies under some conditions. Therefore, the selection of evaluation criteria is crucial to the performance optimization of solar collector system. This study is of great significance to guide the design and optimization of parabolic trough receivers. },

	Abstract = {Abstract This paper presents an exergy analysis to study the effects of operational and environmental parameters on the performance of Parabolic Trough Collectors. The exergy analysis is based on a previous heat transfer model published by the authors. The main parameters considered for the analysis are: inlet temperature and mass flow rate of heat transfer fluid, wind speed, pressure or vacuum in annulus and solar irradiance. The results showed that inlet temperature of heat transfer fluid, solar irradiance, and vacuum in annulus have a significant effect on the thermal and exergetic performance, but the effect of wind speed and mass flow rate of heat transfer fluid is negligible. It was obtained that inlet temperature of heat transfer fluid cannot be optimized to achieve simultaneously maximum thermal and exergetic efficiency because they exhibit opposite trends. Finally, it was found that the highest exergy destruction is due to the heat transfer between the sun and the absorber while for exergy losses is due to optical error. },

	Abstract = {Abstract The design parameters of parabolic trough solar receiver are interrelated and interact with one another, so the optimal performance of solar receiver cannot be obtained by the convectional single-parameter optimization. To overcome the shortcoming of single-parameter optimization, a multi-parameter optimization of parabolic trough solar receiver is employed based on genetic algorithm in the present work. When the thermal efficiency is taken as the objective function, the heat obtained by working fluid increases while the average temperature of working fluid and wall temperatures of solar receiver decrease. The average temperature of working fluid and the wall temperatures of solar receiver increase while the heat obtained by working fluid decreases generally by taking the exergy efficiency as an objective function. Assuming that the solar radiation intensity remains constant, the exergy obtained by working fluid increases by taking exergy efficiency as the objective function, which comes at the expense of heat losses of solar receiver. },

The operating performance and optical efficiency of the parabolic trough solar collectors (PTCs) are different in different regions and different seasons. To determine the optimum design and operation of the parabolic trough solar collector throughout the year, an accurate estimation of the daily performance is needed. In this study, a mathematical model for the optical efficiency of the parabolic trough solar collector was established and three typical regions of solar thermal utilization in China were selected. The performance characteristics of cosine effect, shadowing effect, end loss effect, and optical efficiency were calculated and simulated during a whole year in these three areas by using the mathematical model. The simulation results show that the optical efficiency of PTCs changes from 0.4 to 0.8 in a whole year. The highest optical efficiency of PTCs is in June and the lowest is in December. The optical efficiency of PTCs is mainly influenced by the solar incidence angle. The model is validated by comparing the test results in parabolic trough power plant, with relative error range of 1% to about 5%.},

	Abstract = {Abstract In this paper, detailed exergy analysis of selected thermal power systems driven by parabolic trough solar collectors (PTSCs) is presented. The power is produced using either a steam Rankine cycle (SRC) or a combined cycle, in which the \{SRC\} is the topping cycle and an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is the bottoming cycle. Seven refrigerants for the \{ORC\} were examined: R134a, R152a, R290, R407c, R600, R600a, and ammonia. Key exergetic parameters were examined: exergetic efficiency, exergy destruction rate, fuel depletion ratio, irreversibility ratio, and improvement potential. For all the cases considered it was revealed that as the solar irradiation increases, the exergetic efficiency increases. Among the combined cycles examined, the \{R134a\} combined cycle demonstrates the best exergetic performance with a maximum exergetic efficiency of 26% followed by the \{R152a\} combined cycle with an exergetic efficiency of 25%. Alternatively, the \{R600a\} combined cycle has the lowest exergetic efficiency, 20-21%. This study reveals that the main source of exergy destruction is the solar collector where more than 50% of inlet exergy is destructed, or in other words more than 70% of the total destructed exergy. In addition, more than 13% of the inlet exergy is destructed in the evaporator which is equivalent to around 19% of the destructed exergy. Finally, this study reveals that there is an exergetic improvement potential of 75% in the systems considered. },

The thermal performance of such devices is of major interest for optimising the solar field output and increase the efficiency of power plants. In this paper, a detailed numerical heat transfer model based on the finite volume method for these equipment is presented. In the model, the different elements of the receiver are discretised into several segments in both axial and azimuthal directions and energy balances are applied for each control volume. An optical model is also developed for calculating the non-uniform solar flux distribution around the receiver. This model is based on finite volume method and ray trace techniques and takes into account the finite size of the Sun. The solar heat flux is determined as a pre-processing task and coupled to the energy balance model as a boundary condition for the outer surface of the receiver. The set of algebraic equations are solved simultaneously using direct solvers. The model is thoroughly validated with results from the literature. First, the optical model is compared with known analytical solutions. After that, the performance of the overall model is tested against experimental measurements from Sandia National Laboratories and other un-irradiated receivers experiments. In all cases, results obtained shown a good agreement with experimental and analytical results. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Recently, with decreasing oil resources and environmental issues associated to use of fossil fuels, solar thermal power plants have attracted much attention among researches mainly due to zero emission and huge fuel savings they bring about. In this study, a small scale parabolic Trough collector and a thermal storage tank along with an auxiliary heater are coupled to a Kalina cycle to study the performance of the system throughout the year, both thermodynamically and economically. To examine the effect of solar collectors in the system, the model is compared to a fuel driven Kalina cycle. Results show that in 5 months of the year, the solar fraction is more than 50%. The exergy analysis reveals that the main source of destructions are solar collectors (more than 50% of total) and vapor generator. The solar collectors and vapor generator have an improvement potential of 69% and 65%, respectively. The Kalina cycle is responsible for a minor portion of total exergy destruction, thus more investment should be put on solar collectors. Economic analysis shows that, under design conditions, solar Kalina cycle has a levelized cost of electricity of 0.4274 $/kW h which is higher compared to that of fuel driven cycle with 0.3113 $/kW h. On the other hand, the solar system has a yearly fuel saving of almost 40,000 kg/year (natural gas) which is half of fuel driven cycle and can save more than 100 tons of carbon dioxide. Also, solar fraction and daily mean sun to electricity exergy efficiency of 67.71% and 5.24% are obtained, respectively, for July. Also, the thermal storage tank has a vital role on maintaining the stable working condition of Kalina cycle. To find the effect of key parameters on the performance and economic of solar system, a parametric study has been done. The results show that ammonia mass fraction variation has the most effect on exergy efficiency, solar fraction and levelized cost of electricity. This paper provides the reader to examine the performance of a small scale solar plant from exergetic view point and to estimate the overall costs associated to the system. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Direct steam generation is a potential approach to further reduce the levelized electricity cost of solar trough. Dynamic modeling of the collector loop is essential for operation and control of direct steam generation solar trough. However, the dynamic behavior of fluid based on direct steam generation is complex because of the two-phase flow in the pipeline. In this work, a nonlinear distribution parameter model has been developed to model the dynamic behaviors of direct steam generation parabolic trough collector loops under either full or partial solar irradiance disturbance. Compared with available dynamic model, the proposed model possesses two advantages: (1) real-time local values of heat transfer coefficient and friction resistance coefficient, and (2) considering of the complete loop of collectors, including subcooled water region, two-phase flow region and superheated steam region. The proposed model has shown superior performance, particularly in case of sensitivity study of fluid parameters when the pipe is partially shaded. The proposed model has been validated using experimental data from Solar Thermal Energy Laboratory of University of New South Wales, with an outlet fluid temperature relative error of only 1.91%. The validation results show that: (1) The proposed model successfully outperforms two reference models in predicting the behavior of direct steam generation solar trough. (2) The model theoretically predicts that, during solar irradiance disturbance, the discontinuities of fluid physical property parameters and the moving back and forth of two-phase flow ending location are the reasons that result in the high-frequency chattering of outlet fluid flow. (3) The model validates that the solar irradiance disturbance at subcooled water region would generates larger fluctuation of fluid parameters than two-phase flow region or superheated steam region. },

	Abstract = {Abstract A tubular cavity-receiver that uses air as the heat transfer fluid is evaluated numerically using a validated heat transfer model. The receiver is designed for use on a large-span (9 m net concentrator aperture width) solar parabolic trough concentrator. Through the combination of a parabolic primary concentrator with a nonimaging secondary concentrator, the collector reaches a solar concentration ratio of 97.5. Four different receiver configurations are considered, with smooth or V-corrugated absorber tube and single- or double-glazed aperture window. The collector's performance is characterized by its optical efficiency and heat loss. The optical efficiency is determined with the Monte Carlo ray-tracing method. Radiative heat exchange inside the receiver is calculated with the net radiation method. The 2D steady-state energy equation, which couples conductive, convective, and radiative heat transfer, is solved for the solid domains of the receiver cross-section, using finite-volume techniques. Simulations for Sevilla/Spain at the summer solstice at solar noon (direct normal solar irradiance: 847 W$\cdot$m$^{-2}$, solar incidence angle: 13.9$^\circ$) yield collector efficiencies between 60\% and 65\% at a heat transfer fluid temperature of 125$^\circ{}C$ and between 37\% and 42\% at 500$^\circ{}C$, depending on the receiver configuration. The optical losses amount to more than 30\% of the incident solar radiation and constitute the largest source of energy loss. For a 200 m long collector module operated between 300 and 500$^\circ{}C$, the isentropic pumping power required to pump the \{HTF\} through the receiver is between 11 and 17 kW. },

	Abstract = {Abstract An entirely novel solar receiver design for solar trough concentrators is proposed using air as heat transfer fluid at operating temperatures exceeding 600 $^\circ$C. It consists of an array of helically coiled absorber tubes contained side-by-side within an insulated groove having a rectangular windowed opening. Secondary concentrating optics are incorporated to boost the geometric concentration ratio to 97x. The multiple absorber tubes are connected via two axial pipes serving as feeding and collecting manifolds. The steady-state energy conservation equation coupling radiation, convection, and conduction is formulated and solved numerically using the finite volume technique. The solar flux distribution incident at each absorber tube is determined by Monte Carlo ray-tracing using spectrally and directionally dependent optical properties. Thermal radiative heat exchange is analyzed using the gray-band approximated radiosity method for an enclosure with a selective window. Model validation is accomplished by comparison to on-sun experiments with a 1 m-long solar receiver prototype composed of 7 absorber tubes, mounted on a 4.85 m-aperture solar trough concentrator. Feeding rates in the range of 5-20 ln/min to each absorber tube led to air outlet temperatures of 621-449 $^\circ$C and a peak receiver efficiency of 64%. },

Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the feed-forward back-propagation learning algorithm with three different variants; Levenberge Marguardt (LM), Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG), and Pola-Ribiere Conjugate Gradient (CGP), used in the \{ANN\} to find the best approach for prediction and techno-economic optimization of parabolic trough solar thermal power plant (PTSTPP) integrated with fuel backup system and thermal energy storage.

	Abstract = {Abstract This study investigates numerically, in terms of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), a Parabolic Trough Collector (PTC) system with nanofluid as the Heat Transfer Fluid (HTF). All the heat transfer mechanisms were taken into account to simulate the \{SEGS\} LS2-module PTC. The validation process showed very good agreement between the numerical results and the available test results from four typical testing conditions, with the use of Syltherm 800 liquid oil. Specifically, the maximum relative error observed for outlet temperature was 0.3% and 7.3% for the collector efficiency. In order to address the nanofluid modeling problem the two-phase approach was preferred (against single-phase) and validated against experimental and numerical results for a circular tube under constant wall temperature. Overall, a total of 20 different simulation cases were performed for the \{LS2\} module, for a range of nanoparticle (Al2O3) concentrations (0%-4%), thus making it possible for a parametric evaluation on the \{LS2\} efficiency. In addition, the temperature and velocity fields of the Syltherm 800/Al2O3 nanofluid were associated with the enhanced heat transfer occurring at higher nanoparticle concentrations. A boost up to 10% on the collector efficiency was reported for Al2O3 concentration of 4%, which is in accordance with relevant studies. },

With the 1.8 m2 mirror PV/T system, the characteristic parameters of the space solar cell under non-concentrating solar radiation and concentrating solar radiation are respectively tested experimentally, and the solar cell output characteristics at different opening widths of concentrating mirror of the PV/T stage under condensation are also tested experimentally. When the mirror opening width was 57 cm, the solar cell efficiency reached maximum value of 5.21%. The experimental platform of the two-stage photovoltaic thermal system was established, with a 1.8 m2 mirror PV/T stage and a 15 m2 mirror heating stage, or a 1.8 m2 mirror PV/T stage and a 30 m2 mirror heating stage. The results showed that with single cycle, the long metal cavity heating stage would bring lower thermal efficiency, but temperature rise of the working medium is higher, up to 12.06 掳C with only single cycle. With 30 min closed multiple cycles, the temperature of the working medium in the water tank was 62.8 $^\circ$C, with an increase of 28.7 $^\circ$C, and thermal energy with higher temperature could be output. },

	Abstract = {In this study, performance assessment of a novel system based on parabolic trough solar collectors and an organic Rankine cycle for combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) is presented. In this system, a portion of the waste heat is used for heating through a heat exchanger and the other portion is used for cooling through a single-effect absorption chiller. This study considers three modes of operation: a solar mode, which is characterized by a low-solar radiation; a solar and storage mode, which is characterized by a high-solar radiation; and a storage mode, which is the operation of the system at night time through a thermal storage tank subsystem. To assess the performance improvement of the present system, three further cases are considered: electrical power, cooling-cogeneration, and heating-cogeneration. This system is designed to produce 500 kW of electricity. Different output parameters-efficiency, net electrical power, and electrical to heating and cooling ratios-are examined in this study. This study reveals that the maximum electrical efficiency for the solar mode is 15%, for the solar and storage mode is 7%, and for the storage mode is 6.5%. Alternatively, when \{CCHP\} is used, the efficiency increases significantly. The maximum \{CCHP\} efficiency for the solar mode is 94%, for the solar and storage mode is 47%, and for the storage mode is 42%. Furthermore, this study shows that the electrical to cooling ratio is sensitive to the change in the \{ORC\} pump inlet temperature. Therefore, the variation in this temperature could be used as a good control for the amount of the cooling power needed. },

Knowledge of the dynamic behavior of such system is particularly important as changes in inlet water conditions or in the solar radiation affect the amount of steam generated in the solar field. The process must therefore be controlled to ensure constant quality of produced steam. This work introduces a computational fluid dynamic simulation approach to predict the behavior of a solar steam generating system, which is located at the Plataforma Solar de Almeria, Spain. The STAR-CCM+ code has been used to implement an efficient multiphase model capable of simulating the dynamics of the multiphase fluid in parabolic-trough solar collectors. Numerical and experimental data are compared in a wide range of working conditions. },

The calculation formulae for the optical end loss ratio and the increased optical efficiency (the optical collection efficiency increment of \{PTC\} system after this compensation method is used) are derived; the daily optical end loss ratio, yearly optical end loss ratio, daily increased optical efficiency and yearly increased optical efficiency in different latitudes are calculated; the variation of optical end loss ratio and increased optical efficiency with trough鈥檚 length and latitude angles are analyzed and discussed. It is indicated through the analyses that this compensation method is very applicable for regions with the latitude over 25$^\circ$ (especially over 30$^\circ$) and short trough collectors. In order to verify the feasibility of the compensation method, a five-meter PTC-HNSA experimental system was built. The increased thermal efficiency of the experimental system is measured, and the result that the experimental value (increased thermal efficiency) substantially agreed with the theoretical value (increased optical efficiency) is gained. All these works can offer some valuable references to the further study on high-efficiency trough solar concentrating systems. },

In this paper, the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) method is developed to model and optimize the parabolic trough solar collector system. Numerical simulations are implemented to evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of the \{LSSVM\} method, where the sample data derived from the experiment and the simulation results of two solar collector systems with 30 m2 and 600 m2 solar fields, and the complicated relationship between the solar collector efficiency and the solar flux, the flow rate and the inlet temperature of the heat transfer fluid (HTF) is extracted. Some basic rules, such as the solar collector efficiency increases with the increase of the solar flux and the flow rate of the heat transfer fluid, and decreases with the increase of the inlet temperature of the HTF, are obtained, which indicates the \{LSSVM\} method is competent to optimize the solar collector systems. As a result, the new approach will provide meaningful data for developing the parabolic trough solar thermal power plant in China. },

	Abstract = {Abstract The solar receiver plays a key role in the performance of a solar dish electric generator. Its radiation flux distribution can directly affect the efficiency of the parabolic solar concentrator system. In this paper, radiation flux distribution of the receiver is simulated successfully using \{MCRT\} method. The impacts of incident solar irradiation, aspect ratio (the ratio of the receiver height to the receiver diameter), and system error on the radiation flux of the receiver are investigated. The parameters are studied in the following ranges: incident solar irradiation from 100 to 1100 W/m2, receiver aspect ratio from 0.5 to 1.5, and the system error from 0 to 10 mrad. A non-dimensional parameter Θ is defined to represent the ratio of radiation flux to incident solar irradiation. The results show that the maximum of Θ is about 200 in simulation conditions. The aspect ratio and system error have a significant impact on the radiation flux. The optimal receiver aspect ratio is 1.5 at a constant incident solar irradiation, and the maximum of radiation flux increases with decreasing system error, however, the radiation flux distribution can benefit from a large system error. Meanwhile, effects of integral dish and multi-dishes on the radiation flux distribution have been investigated. The results show that the accuracy of two cases can be ignored within the same parameters. },

The exergy factor parameter is also proposed for quantifying the thermal performance. The exergy factor is found to be high under conditions of high solar radiation and under high operating temperatures. The heat loss factor of the receiver is determined to be around 4.6 W/K. An optical efficiency of around 52% for parabolic dish system is determined under high solar radiation conditions. This experimental setup can be used as teaching tool for people with little or no knowledge about solar dish concentrators due its simplicity and the basic mathematical formulations applied.

The focal image characteristics of the solar dish are determined to propose the suitable design of absorber/receiver. First, theoretical thermal performance analysis of the fuzzy focal solar parabolic dish concentrator with modified cavity receiver is carried out for different operating conditions. Based on the theoretical performance analysis, the total heat loss (conduction, convection and radiation heat losses) from the modified cavity receiver is estimated. It is observed that the maximum theoretical efficiencies of solar dish collector are found to be as 79.2\% for no wind conditions and 78.2\% and 77.8\% for side-on and head-on winds speed of 5 m/s respectively. Latter, real time analysis of parabolic dish collector with modified cavity receiver is carried out in terms of stagnation test, time constant test and daily performance test. From stagnation test, the overall heat loss coefficient is found to be 356 W/m2 K. The time constant test is carried out to determine the influence of sudden change in solar radiation at steady state conditions. The daily performance tests are conducted for different flow rates. It is found that the efficiency of the collector increases with the increase of volume flow rates. The average thermal efficiencies of the parabolic dish collector for the volume flow rate of 100 L/h and 250 L/h are found to be 69\% and 74\% for the average beam radiation (Ibn) of 532 W/m2 and 641 W/m2 respectively. },

	Abstract = {Abstract In this article, total heat losses from three configurations of modified cavity receiver of solar parabolic dish are investigated using 3-D numerical model. The effects of various parameters such as diameter ratio (d/D), angle of inclination (θ), operating temperature (T), insulation thickness (t) and emissivity (ε) of the cavity cover on the heat losses from the modified cavity receiver are investigated. The variable boundary conditions are considered for modified cavity receiver to produce sub-cooled hot water, saturated steam and superheated steam. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is developed to predict the heat loss for a large set of influencing parameters. Based on \{ANN\} modelling, improved Nusselt number correlations are proposed for convective, radiative and total heat losses from the modified cavity receiver. The convective heat losses are greatly influenced by receiver inclination whereas the radiation heat losses are influenced by the cavity cover emissivity. The diameter ratio also plays a major role in heat losses from the cavity receiver. The total heat loss is estimated as 522 W for superheat steam condition for θ = 0 and d/D = 0.05; whereas it is 288 W for diameter ratio 1. The total heat loss varies 25\% for inclinations 0 and 90$\,^{\circ}$. For saturated and sub-cooled steam conditions, the total heat loss variation is found to be 28\% and 21\% respectively from 0 to 90$\,^{\circ}$ inclinations for diameter ratio of 0.05. The present method predicts the heat losses more accurately compared with the existing models. },

In order to validate the experimental results of the \{SHE\} and to determine the \{SPC\} efficiency using the disk, an analytical study based on thermodynamics analysis is carried out. We note that a good agreement between the four experimental methods has been obtained with the four receivers used in this work. The thermal energy efficiency varies from 40\% to 77\%, the concentrating system reaches an average exergy efficiency of 50\% and a concentration factor around 178. },

	Abstract = {In country like India demand of energy increases with increase in population so the use of renewable and natural sources of energy like wind energy, tidal energy, solar energy etc is the need of time in country. In this paper we present development and experimental study of two axis automatic control of solar tracking system using Arduino. In hardware development five light dependent resistors (LDR) has been used to sense and gather maximum solar energy. Two permanent magnet DC motors are used to move the solar dish according to the solar energy sensed by LDR. In software part we design a controller which will move the collector dish to track the sun. The controller uses LDR sensors as input and permanent magnet DC geared motors as an output. LDR are used to sense the intensity of light and generate the signals which will be further processed by ATmega328 microcontroller. Microcontroller executes the algorithm and gives control command to motor driver. This paper describes development of automatic dual axis solar tracking system for solar parabolic dish.},

	Abstract = {Solar energy may be practically utilized directly through transformation into heat, electrical or chemical energy. We present a procedure to design a square facet concentrator for laboratory-scale research on medium-temperature thermal processes. The efficient conversion of solar radiation into heat at these temperature levels requires the use of concentrating solar collectors. Large concentrating dishes generally have a reflecting surface made up of a number of individual mirror panels (facets). Optical ray tracing is used to generate a system performance model. A square facet parabolic solar concentrator with realistic specularly surface and facet positioning accuracy will deliver up to 13.604 kW of radiative power over a 250 mm radius disk (receiver diameter) located in the focal plane on the focal length of 1500mm with average concentrating ratio exceeding 1200. The Monte Carlo ray tracing method is used for analysis of the optical performance of the concentrator and to identify t},

	Abstract = {Abstract In this article, a 3-D numerical modeling is carried out to determine combined convection and surface radiation heat losses from a modified cavity receiver of parabolic dish collector used as mono-tube boiler for sub-cooled, saturated and superheated steam generation conditions. The forced convection heat loss from the modified cavity receiver is estimated using Nusselt number correlation developed for the modified cavity receiver. The effect of receiver inclination ( β ) , operating temperature ( T w ) , emissivity of the cavity cover ( ∊ ) , thickness of insulation ( t ins ) on the combined heat losses from the modified cavity receiver is investigated. The boundary conditions for wall temperature and insulation thicknesses are chosen to match the three steam generation conditions. It is found that the natural convection heat losses are higher at β = 0 $\,^{\circ}$ (receiver facing sideward) and lower at β = 90 $\,^{\circ}$ (receiver facing down) whereas the forced convection heat loss is higher at β = 90 $\,^{\circ}$ and lower at β = 0 $\,^{\circ}$ . The variation of radiation heat losses is marginal for all values of β and vary with T w . The effect of various parameters such as receiver inclination, wind direction ( φ ) , wind speed and diameter ratios on forced convection heat loss from the receiver has also been studied. The forced convection heat loss at lower wind speeds (&lt;2.5 m/s) is lower than the natural convection heat losses. The maximum heat losses occur at side-on wind direction ( φ = 0 ) followed by head-on wind directions ( φ = 30--90$\,^{\circ}$) and back-on wind directions ( φ = - 90 $\,^{\circ}$ to - 30 $\,^{\circ}$ ) . The heat losses vary with diameter ratios for different configurations of the receiver. The forced convection heat loss is 1.2--9 times higher than natural convection heat loss for diameter ratio (ratio of cavity diameter to aperture diameter, d/D) = 0.4 at 5 m/s and receiver inclinations varying from 0$\,^{\circ}$ to 90 $\,^{\circ}$ . Nusselt number correlations have been proposed based on the numerical analysis to estimate the combined convective and radiative heat loss. The present study attempts to estimate natural convection, forced convection and surface radiation heat losses from the modified cavity receiver under various conditions. },
