@article{Zou2017b,
	Abstract = {Abstract The geometric parameters of a cavity receiver play critical roles in solar energy conversion and heat transfer. However, the effects of geometric parameters on thermal performance have not been studied sufficiently, especially for a cylinder cavity receiver with a 3D numerical model. In the present study, the effects of aperture diameter and cavity length are numerically simulated using the finite element method by ANSYS 17.0. The combined convection and radiation loss is taken into consideration in the simulation process. A simulation validation is also proposed with a comparison between the numerical simulation result and published data from the theoretical model. Good agreement has been achieved. The combined heat loss increases considerably with an increase in aperture diameter from 184mm to 300mm. Attending to the number of loops and the corresponding cavity length, a maximum thermal efficiency is achieved with five loops at a 480mm cavity length. This paper provides a successful example of the design of a cylinder cavity receiver.},

@article{Benammar2014,
	Abstract = {Abstract In this paper, a mathematical model based on energy analysis, has been developed for modeling and simulation of solar tower power plants (STPP) performances without energy storage. The STPP system has been divided into four main subsystems: the heliostat field subsystem, the cavity receiver subsystem (tower), the steam generation subsystem and the power cycle subsystem (Rankine cycle). Thermal and thermodynamic models of main subsystems have been developed. A general nonlinear mathematical model of the studied system (STPP) has been presented and solved using numerical optimization methods. The obtained results are presented and analyzed. The effects of the receiver surface temperature and the receiver surface area on the cavity receiver efficiency and the steam mass flow have been investigated. The effects of other parameters, such as the incident heat flux, the absorbed energy and the heat losses from the receiver are also studied. The analysis of these results shows the existence of an optimal receiver efficiency value for each steam mass flow, receiver surface temperature and receiver surface area.},

	Abstract = {Abstract This paper describes the influence of the solar multiple on the annual performance of parabolic trough solar thermal power plants with direct steam generation (DSG). The reference system selected is a 50MWe DSG power plant, with thermal storage and auxiliary natural gas-fired boiler. It is considered that both systems are necessary for an optimum coupling to the electricity grid. Although thermal storage is an opening issue for DSG technology, it gives an additional degree of freedom for plant performance optimization. Fossil hybridization is also a key element if a reliable electricity production must be guaranteed for a defined time span. Once the yearly parameters of the solar power plant are calculated, the economic analysis is performed, assessing the effect of the solar multiple in the levelized cost of electricity, as well as in the annual natural gas consumption.},

@article{Gonzalez2017,
	Abstract = {Abstract Thermal energy storage systems are key components of concentrating solar power plants in order to offer energy dispatchability to adapt the electricity power production to the curve demand. This paper presents a review of the current commercial thermal energy storage systems used in solar thermal power plants: steam accumulators and molten salts. It describes the mentioned storage concepts and the results of their economic evaluation. The economic value of the TES system is assessed by the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) calculation, an economic performance metric commonly used in power generation in order to compare cost of electricity among different power generation sources. Lots of studies have been done in the past to compare the LCOE of a complete solar thermal power plant using thermal energy storage systems. However, no specific studies related to the thermal energy storage levelized cost of electricity itself were done. The objective of this study is focused in the comparison of the TES LCOE where calculations are done for a 100MW Rankine cycle with different plant configuration and for different storage sizes ranging from 1 to 9h of equivalent full capacity operation.},

The commercialization of this technology has involved a re-design of the Big Dish concept for mass production. The new design is a 500m2 concentrator with 13.4m focal length and altitude--azimuth tracking. It uses 380 identical spherical 1.17m×1.17m mirror panels, which incorporate the Glass-on-Metal Laminate mirrors. Construction of a first prototype on the ANU campus began in the first quarter of 2008. The first on sun test was carried out on 29 June 2009.},

@article{Wang2017,
	Abstract = {Abstract In this paper, the effects of cavity surface materials on the radiative flux distribution of solar cavity receivers have been studied with the help of a ray-tracing methodology. Three metallic substrate materials (Inconel 600, austenitic stainless steel 253 MA and Kanthal APM) and two coating materials (Pyromark{\textregistered} 2500 coating and YSZ TBC coating) were selected as the candidate cavity surface materials. The results show that the flux distribution and the total optical efficiency are much more sensitive to the absorptivity on the cylindrical surface than on the bottom. By using high absorptivity coating on the cylindrical surface and low absorptivity coating on the bottom, the radiative flux on the bottom can be controlled at a low level, and it can help to reduce the cavity length for an impinging receiver with jets on the cylindrical surface. Furthermore, the radiative flux distribution on the cylindrical surface can also be tailored to meet various design requirements by applying different coating designs on the cylindrical surface.},

A five-meter long PTC experimental system was used for testing the increased thermal efficiencies of PTC with these methods. The experimental results (increased thermal efficiencies) are agreed with theoretical results (increased optical efficiencies), which proves that these reduction or compensation methods are feasible and effective.

	Abstract = {Abstract In this article, experimental investigation of 15 m2 solar parabolic trough collector with porous disc enhanced receiver is carried out according to ASHRAE 93-1986 test procedure. Six different receiver configurations are developed and investigated to compare their performance. The performance of solar parabolic trough collector with two conventional and four porous disc receivers is characterized in terms of time constant, collector acceptance angle, peak performance, daily performance and heat loss tests. The tests are carried out for wide range of flow rates (100 L/h--1000 L/h) and weather conditions. Based on experimental investigation, the time constant of the parabolic trough collector is varied from 70 s to 260 s for different receiver configurations. The collector acceptance angle is determined for both un-shielded tubular receiver (USTR) and shielded tubular receiver (STR) as 0.58$\,^{\circ}$ and 0.68$\,^{\circ}$ respectively. The collector efficiencies are obtained as in the range of 63.9%--66.66% under ASHRAE standard test condition. Off-Sunset heat loss test is conducted to determine the steady state heat losses from the parabolic trough collector receiver. The heat losses from the parabolic trough collector are in the range of 455 W/m2--1732 W/m2 for average fluid temperature of Tamb + 30 $\,^{\circ}$C. Stagnation temperature of the collector is obtained as 258 $\,^{\circ}$C and 312 $\,^{\circ}$C respectively for USTR and STR corresponding to direct normal insolation (DNI) of 786 W/m2 and 761 W/m2. Based on the above analysis, the porous disc enhanced receiver improves the performance of the parabolic trough collector significantly and it can be used effectively for process heat applications.},

Collector/HCE simulation results for many different field operation conditions were used to create heat loss correlationcoefficients for Excelergy and SAM.

	Abstract = {Abstract In the present work, a novel parabolic trough solar collector model has been developed and validated. The validation has been carried out through a comparison with results of previous studies conducted in the worldwide most renowned laboratories, i.e., Sandia National Laboratory (SNL) and National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NERL). The comparison with experimental data collected by SNL, during LS-2 tests at AZTRAK platform, has shown good agreement, particularly for the case of receivers with Cermet coating. When compared with the Engineering Equation Solver (EES) code developed by NREL, the novel model offers improvements in the accuracy of thermal performance prediction. It has been found that the proposed model in the present study predicts more accurately the thermal efficiency than EES; with an average uncertainty of 0.64% compared to 1.11% for ESS, in the case of Cermet coating. Nevertheless, minor inaccuracy in the estimation of heat losses at higher operation temperatures has been found due to the error propagation in the model. The present work also includes a survey of the design and manufacturing processes of the parabolic trough collector that are of a particular interest for developing this promising technology.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The influences of sunshape and incident angle on the optical performance of the parabolic trough solar collector (PTC) are investigated comprehensively based on Monte Carlo Ray Tracing (MCRT) method and theoretical analysis. This study adopts the acceptance-rejection sampling method, instead of the direct sampling method, for random variable sampling to reduce computing complexity. Both the energy proportion bounded by any angle span in the optical cone and the end loss caused by any incident angle are derived theoretically. It is revealed that the sunshape has great effects on the optical performance of a PTC, which should be taken into consideration in practice. The geometrical configuration of the PTC, especially the absorber tube diameter, should be determined to meet the energy requirement based on local sunshape (circumsolar ratio) conditions. It is also found that the end loss, caused by the incident angle, weakens the optical efficiency. Larger aperture width and smaller absorber diameter will cause greater end loss for constant incident angle. When the absorber length is long enough, the effect of incident angle will be negligible. In a range of small focal lengths, the optical efficiency increases with the increase of focal length, and then decreases constantly with further increasing focal length. Findings in this paper can be used as reference or guidance for designing and optimizing PTC's structure in practice.},

@article{Cheng2015,
	Abstract = {In this paper, an optimization model on optical performance of parabolic trough solar collector (PTC) systems is developed, based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and the Monte Carlo ray-tracing (MCRT) method. Since the computing time of a single MCRT simulation is always very critical to the whole optimization process and even to the feasibility of the optimization analysis if it is very time-consuming. Therefore, a MCRT runtime reduction method (RRM) was firstly proposed, by making a reasonable trade-off between the computational accuracy and the computing cost. Subsequently, the RRM was checked using well known statistical indices, due to the random number generation in the MCRT simulation and the statistical nature of the MCRT methodology. It is very significant that the corresponding calculation amount and computing time of a PTC MCRT simulation reduce by orders of magnitude and thus make the whole population-based PSO optimization process relative much feasible. Then a preliminary PSO--MCRT optimization analysis was carried out for an existing PTC system with known optimal optical performance, as it can be used to compare with the optimization results directly and thus to validate the PSO--MCRT optimization model. It is revealed that optimization results agree well with the reference data (Cheng et al., 2014), proving that the PSO--MCRT method and model used in the present study are feasible and reliable. In addition, error analysis and some further studies based on this proposed model are also discussed.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Direct steam generation in parabolic-trough collectors is considered a promising option for reducing the cost of electricity produced in solar thermal power plants. Indeed, the use of water instead of thermal oil allows reaching high temperature levels and reducing plant complexity. Furthermore, the integration of thermal energy storage system and the hybridization of the plant with a biomass boiler permit further cost reduction. This paper focuses on the historical and technological development of the direct steam generation concept and the thermoeconomic analysis of a hybrid direct steam generation-biomass power plant equipped with a thermal energy storage system. The exergy balance and cost balance equations have been applied to each component of the plant in four different operating modes that take into account the intermittency of the solar source. Exergy results show that the solar field requires further development in order to reduce associated irreversibilities. Finally, it was found that the integration of a thermal energy storage system and hybridization with a biomass boiler reduce the final cost of electricity to 17.36c€/kW he. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Energy recovery is a process strategy seeking to improve process efficiency through the capture, recycle and deployment of normally neglected low energy content sources or streams. By proper optimal process design, such low-temperature energy sources can be a feasible and economical manner of approaching the energy recovery issue. In particular, when Rankine cycles with mixtures as working fluids are used, the amount of energy recovery can be improved. The formulation and systematic solution of this problem has shown better results when all the variables of the Rankine cycle and the compositions of the working fluid are considered simultaneously. Another interesting approach is the implementation of multiple cycles coupled together. In this work we propose a nonlinear optimization formulation of two general multistage approaches for the Rankine cycle with mixtures: the cascade and series configurations. As main decision variables, we have considered the heat source conditions and the mixture components. Then, the resulting optimization problem is solved in a deterministic approach as a nonlinear program. The results shown that for some cases the multistage configurations are useful but limited in terms of cost in comparison to the single stage cycle. },

	Abstract = {This paper presents thermodynamic investigation and environmental consideration of combined Stirling-organic Rankine cycle (ORC) power cycle. Combined cycle can be assisted by solar energy and an ORC used as an annular cold-side heat rejector for a free piston Stirling cycle. ORC can increase the power output efficiency by 4{\%} to 8{\%} compared to that of a Stirling standard cycle. Operating temperatures of ORC are between 80{\textdegree}C and 140{\textdegree}C. The main objective of this work is to model the combined cycle for performance optimization in respect to the use of several different working fluids with relevant temperature ranges. Total power efficiency in the range of 34{\%} to 42{\%} was observed for different cases. Several working fluids in the ORC were investigated from a thermal, operational, and environmental point of view. Working fluids considered were FC72, FC87, HFE7100, HFE7000, Novec649, n-pentane, n-decane, R245fa, and toluene. Practical issues like thermodynamic cycle efficiency, latent heat, density, toxicity, flammability, ozone depletion potential, global warming potential, and atmospheric lifetime are considered. Considering the cycle efficiency, n-decane shows the best performance at both levels of temperature supposed. However, this fluid has the highest saturated vapor specific volume (resulting in a larger condenser) and the lowest condenser saturation pressure (higher infiltration of non-condensable gases). The best candidates for the cycle regarding all the considered aspects were found to be toluene, HFE7100, and n-pentane. Comparing these three fluids, toluene presents the highest efficiency, the highest impact on the environment, the biggest vapor specific volume, and the minimum mass flow rate in Rankine cycle, therefore decreasing the pump power consumption. N-pentane exhibits the lowest cycle efficiency and vapor specific volume, but this fluid has super-atmospheric saturation pressure advantage. HFE7100 is a good working fluid from environmental and safety point of view.},

	Abstract = {An energy prediction model was created for solar Stirling dish systems to predict the location dependent long term performance of these systems. The model analyzes the performance of the parabolic mirror, receiver, Stirling engine, and the parasitic power consumption to predict the net power produced. The performance prediction models were implemented in TRNSYS and include location dependent properties that affect the performance based on the direct normal insolation, ambient temperature, density of air (altitude), sun elevation angle, and the wind speed. This thesis outlines the theory and models for the collector, receiver, Stirling engine, and the parasitic power including the cooling system pump, fan, and cooling tower. Several detailed Stirling dish system component models were compared with three years of data from the Wilkinson, Goldberg, and Associates, Inc. (WGA) Mod 2-2 system to determine which model most accurately replicated the data. The best detailed component model has separate components for the collector, receiver, Stirling engine, and parasitic power consumption. The model uses theory from Stine and Harrigan (1985) for the collector, Stine and McDonald (1989) for natural convection from the receiver, Ma (1993) for forced convection from the receiver, a performance curve fit using data for the Stirling engine by correcting the Beale number (Urieli and Berchowitz, 1984) with a temperature correction term (McMahan, 2007), and the parasitic power model uses performance theory from the fan laws and dimensionless pump performance correlations. The best detailed component model determined during this research predicted the net performance of the WGA Stirling dish system more accurately than existing Stirling dish system models when using one day of data to generate the performance curves. The standard deviation predicting the total energy over a three year period of WGA data for the proposed model compared was 4.0 {\%}, whereas the most accurate existing model was 6.5 {\%}, and another model was 6.9 {\%}. The average difference in power with the current model was 575 W, the most accurate existing model was 640 W, and another model was 680 W. Scatter in the data contributed to 490 W for the average difference in power, which may be mostly due to mirror soiling daily variation. The proposed model is also expected to show a greater improvement in accuracy over the existing models when predicting the system performance in different locations due to the additional location dependent properties of the wind velocity, sun elevation angle, and altitude. The proposed model is capable of accurately predicting the Stirling dish system performance over a long period of time using only one day of data. The detailed component model was implemented in TRNSYS and requires hourly data of the direct normal insolation, atmospheric pressure, ambient temperature, wind speed, and sun elevation angle to calculate the net electrical power produced. The user can automatically specify characteristic parameters for any the four Stirling dish systems manufactured by WGA, Stirling Energy Systems Inc. (SES), Schlaich-Bergermann und Partner (SBP), and Science Applications International Corp. (SAIC). It is also possible for the user to vary the parameters of the collector, receiver, Stirling engine, and parasitic power model for values not characteristic of these systems. The TRNSYS Stirling dish system model is flexible enough to predict the system performance by changing several parameters or components. A sample of the system parameters includes the receiver aperture diameter, heater head operating temperature, operating speed of the cooling fan and pump, cooling fluid, and the receiver geometry,. The system components can also be modified in the TRNSYS model to determine how the system performance changes by replacing a direct illumination receiver (DIR) with a reflux receiver, running the system in a hybrid mode with a quartz cover over the receiver aperture, or replacing the fan and radiator with a central cooling tower. A summary of various TRNSYS simulation results can be found in this thesis using different design scenarios and operating parameters for the WGA system in specific locations.},

@article{Rovira2011,
	Abstract = {In the paper, two systems for solar thermal power plants (STPPs) are devised for improving the overall performance of the plant. Each one attempts to reduce losses coming from two respective sources. The systems are simulated and compared to a reference STPP. They consists on: (a) a double thermal energy storage (DTS) with different functionalities for each storage and (b) the subdivision of the solar collector field (SSF) into specialised sectors, so that each sector is designed to meet a thermal requirement, usually through an intermediate heat exchanger. This subdivision reduces the losses in the solar field by means of a decrease of the temperature of the heat transfer fluid (HTF). Double thermal energy storage is intended for keeping the plant working at nominal level for many hours a day, including post-sunset hours. One of the storages gathers a fluid which is heated up to temperatures above the nominal one. In order to make it work, the solar field must be able to overheat the fluid at peak hours. The second storage is the classical one. The combination of both allows the manager of the plant to keep the nominal of the plant for longer periods than in the case of classical thermal energy storage. To the authors' knowledge, it is the first time that both configurations are presented and simulated for the case of parabolic through \{STPP\} with \{HTF\} technology. The results show that, if compared to the reference STPP, both configurations may raise the annual electricity generation (up to 1.7% for the \{DTS\} case and 3.9% for the \{SSF\} case). },

	Abstract = {A solar chimney system for power production at high latitudes has been designed and its performance has been evaluated. A mathematical model and a code on \{MATLAB\} platform have been developed based on monthly average meteorological data and thermodynamic cycle. The thermal performance of a 5 \{MW\} nominal power production plant at three locations in Canada, namely Ottawa, Winnipeg and Edmonton, is studied. The sloped collector field is built at suitable mountain hills, which also functions as a chimney. Then a short vertical chimney is added to install the vertical axis air turbine. The results showed that solar chimney power plants at high latitudes may have satisfactory thermal performance and produce as much as 85% of the same plants in southern locations with horizontal collector field. The overall thermal performance of these plants is a little less than 0.5%. },

	N2 = {Up to now, nearly all the experimental and theoretical work treating convective heat loss of cavity receivers had been effected for downward and sideward-facing receivers, as they are used in dish concentrators and solar power towers. With a test facility it was possible to show flow patterns and a temperature field in a hot cavity for a variety of parameter settings and over the whole range of tilt angles. Two types of geometries were examined: a spherical and a hemispherical cavity, both with an inner diameter of 400 mm, the aperture diameter ranging between 60 and 195 mm. Temperatures were varied between 573 K and 873 K. The dependence of losses on temperature, tilt angle, aperture-radius, geometry, ribs, and ventilation is reported. Special emphasis is invested to get an understanding of the air flow in an upward facing cavity. Based on the works of Clausing et al. (1987), and Stine and McDonald (1989), two algorithms are developed that allow the calculation of convective loss from upward-facing receivers. Over the whole range of tilt angles, calculated results are compared with measurements. Good agreement between the calculated and measured data is found.},

	Abstract = {The convection heat loss from cavity receiver in parabolic dish solar thermal power system can significantly reduce the efficiency and consequently the cost effectiveness of the system. It is important to assess this heat loss and subsequently improve the thermal performance of the receiver. This paper aims to present a comprehensive review and systematic summarization of the state of the art in the research and progress in this area. The efforts include the convection heat loss mechanism, experimental and numerical investigations on the cavity receivers with varied shapes that have been considered up to date, and the Nusselt number correlations developed for convection heat loss prediction as well as the wind effect. One of the most important features of this paper is that it has covered numerous cavity literatures encountered in various other engineering systems, such as those in electronic cooling devices and buildings. The studies related to those applications may provide valuable information for the solar receiver design, which may otherwise be ignored by a solar system designer. Finally, future development directions and the issues that need to be further investigated are also suggested. It is believed that this comprehensive review will be beneficial to the design, simulation, performance assessment and applications of the solar parabolic dish cavity receivers. },

	Abstract = {In a Stirling cycle a huge amount of energy is wasted due to the losses. This wasted energy may be utilised as a heat source for the boiler of an organic Rankine cycle (ORC). Combination of these two cycles leads to an increased cycle efficiency compared to a single Stirling cycle and the analysis and optimisation of the integrated system is carried out. Optimisation is performed using the genetic algorithm and considering three decision variables: the temperature of the cold tank of the Stirling cycle, the pressure ratio and the temperature of the ORC condenser. In optimisation, the efficiency is considered as the objective function and the highest value is achieved by adjusting the decision variables. Using this method, the efficiency of the overall combined cycle was improved in which the highest efficiency was obtained to be 41.5{\%}.},

	Abstract = {A novel solar electricity generation system (SEGS) using cascade cycle is proposed. The top and the bottom are steam Rankine cycle (SRC) and organic Rankine cycle (ORC). Particulary, screw expander (SE), which is characterized by good applicability in power conversion with steam--liquid mixture, is employed in the SRC. Steam is generated directly in the parabolic trough collectors (PTC) and expands in the SE. The heat released by steam condensation is used to drive the ORC. This type of SEGS has the advantages of avoidance of superheated steam, moderate operating temperature and pressure, low technical requirements in heat collection and storage, and suitableness for distributed power generation. Simulation of the system performance is conducted on the use of ten ORC fluids. Four hot/cold side temperatures of 473/313K, 473/293K, 523/313K and 523/293K are exemplified. The results indicate the ORC evaporation temperature corresponding to theoretical maximum solar power efficiency fails to provide a pressure ratio (PR) that matches the SE built-in PR. Off-design operation of the SE is recommended for the purpose of higher system efficiency and simpler ORC turbine. Efficiency of 13.68--15.62{\%} for the proposed system can be achieved.},

Two conceptual designs are explored: (1) integrating gas turbines with conventional oil heat-transfer-fluid (HTF) troughs running at 390 $\,^{\circ}$C, and (2) integrating gas turbines with salt-HTF troughs running at 450 $\,^{\circ}$C and including thermal energy storage (TES). The latter system is also representative of molten-salt power towers, although the power towers run at temperatures near 565 $\,^{\circ}$C and would require selection of an appropriate gas turbine to provide waste heat at those temperatures. Using gas turbine waste heat to supplement the \{TES\} system provides operating flexibility while enhancing the efficiency of gas utilization. The analysis indicates that the hybrid plant designs produce solar-derived electricity and gas-derived electricity at lower costs than either system operating alone. },

@article{Manente2016,
	Abstract = {Abstract The integration of solar energy into natural gas combined cycles has been successfully demonstrated in several integrated solar combined cycles since the beginning of this decade in many countries. There are many motivations that drive investments on integrated solar combined cycles which are primarily the repowering of existing power plants, the compliance with more severe environmental laws on emissions and the mitigation of risks associated with large solar projects. Integrated solar combined cycles are usually developed as brownfield facilities by retrofitting existing natural gas combined cycles and keeping the existing equipment to minimize costs. In this work a detailed off-design model of a 390 \{MWe\} three pressure level natural gas combined cycle is built to evaluate different integration schemes of solar energy which either keep the equipment of the combined cycle unchanged or include new equipment (steam turbine, heat recovery steam generator). Both power boosting and fuel saving operation strategies are analyzed in the search for the highest annual efficiency and solar share. Results show that the maximum incremental power output from solar at design solar irradiance is limited to 19 \{MWe\} without modifications to the existing equipment. Higher values are attainable only including a larger steam turbine. High solar radiation-to-electrical efficiencies in the range 24--29% can be achieved in the integrated solar combined cycle depending on solar share and extension of tube banks in the heat recovery steam generator. Compared to power boosting, the fuel saving strategy shows lower thermal efficiencies of the integrated solar combined cycle due to the efficiency drop of gas turbine at reduced loads. Without modifications to the existing equipment the maximum solar share of the total generated electricity is only about 1%. },

@article{Alqahtani2016,
	Abstract = {Abstract Integrated Solar Combined Cycle Power Plants (ISCCs), composed of a Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plant and a Natural Gas-Fired Combined Cycle (NGCC) power plant, have been recently introduced in the power generation sector as a technology with the potential to simultaneously reduce fossil fuel usage and the costs of integrating solar power in an electricity system. This study quantifies the economic and environmental benefits of an \{ISCC\} power plant relative to a stand-alone \{CSP\} with energy storage, and a \{NGCC\} plant. The corresponding levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and the Cost of Carbon Abatement (CoA) are estimated by simulating hourly operations for five U.S. locations with different solar resources and ambient temperature, under varying assumptions regarding natural gas prices, tax incentives, capacity factors, and capital costs. Results show that integrating the \{CSP\} into an \{ISCC\} reduces the \{LCOE\} of solar-generated electricity by 35--40% relative to a stand-alone \{CSP\} plant, and provides the additional benefit of dispatchability. An \{ISCC\} also outperforms a \{CSP\} with energy storage in terms of \{LCOE\} and CoA. The current \{LCOE\} of an \{ISCC\} is lower than that of a stand-alone \{NGCC\} when natural gas prices reach 13.5 $/MMBtu, while its CoA is lower at a fuel price of 8.5 $/MMBtu. Although, under low to moderate natural gas price conditions, a \{NGCC\} generates electricity and abates carbon emissions at a lower cost than an ISCC; small changes in the capacity factor of an \{ISCC\} relative to the NGCC, or capital cost reductions for the \{CSP\} components significantly tilt the balance in the ISCC's favor. Hence, this technology should be seriously considered as a cost-effective baseload electricity generation alternative to speed up the transition to sustainable energy systems. },

	Abstract = {Integrated Solar Combined Cycles (ISCC) are currently used in countries with high incident solar radiation in order to increase the net output power and decrease the specific fuel consumption. The present work introduces a modified ISCC with two bottoming cycles. The first bottoming cycle is a steam Rankine cycle while the second one is an Organic Rankine Cycle ORC. Multistage compression with intercooling was considered for the gas turbine unit. The ORC was used in order to intercool the compressed air and produce a net power from the received thermal energy. The proposed cycle performance was studied and optimized. Fifteen working fluids were investigated for use with the ORC. Results showed that R1234ze(z) introduces a good compromise between thermodynamics, economic, safety and environmental considerations. The cycle with R1234ze(z) as a working fluid showed an increase of the output power by 19.5{\%} with solar contribution and 23.1{\%} without solar contribution. The increase of the net output power with the application of the proposed cycle is higher than the power produced from a 50MW solar field. Moreover, the proposed cycle is less affected by variations of the ambient temperature.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Integrated solar combined cycle (ISCC) systems have become more and more popular due to their high fuel and solar energy utilization efficiencies. Conventional \{ISCC\} systems with direct steam generation (DSG) have only one-stage solar input. A novel \{ISCC\} with \{DSG\} system has been proposed and analyzed in this paper. The new system consists two-stage solar input, which would significantly increase solar share in the total power output. Moreover, how and where solar energy is input into \{ISCC\} system would have impact on the solar and system overall efficiencies, which have been analyzed in the paper. It has been found that using solar heat to supply latent heat for vaporization of feedwater would be superior to that to be used for sensible heating purposes (e.g. Superheating steam). The study shows that: (1) producing both the high- and low-pressure saturated steam in the \{DSG\} trough collector could be an efficient way to improve process and system performance; (2) for a given live steam pressure, the optimum secondary and reheat steam conditions could be matched to reach the highest system thermal efficiency and net solar-to-electricity efficiency; (3) the net solar-to-electricity efficiency could reach up to 30% in the novel two-stage \{ISCC\} system, higher than that in the one-stage \{ISCC\} power plant; (4) compared with the conventional combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power system, lower stack temperature could be achieved, owing to the elimination of the approach-temperature-difference constraint, resulting in better thermal match in the heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) and thus more feedwater could be circulated. },

	Abstract = {Issue Title: Special Issue Section: Issues on Water, Manufacturing, and Energy Sustainability A concentrating solar power (CSP) plant with parabolic trough collector (PTC) using thermal oil as heat transfer fluid (HTF) is the most commercially established technology. On the other hand, linear Fresnel reflectors (LFRs) with direct steam generation (DSG) are developed and proposed as cheaper alternative to PTC systems. The optical efficiency of LFR systems is lower than that of PTC systems. Also low-cost LFR systems produce saturated steam, resulting in higher aperture area requirement compared to PTC-based CSP plants of the same capacity. In this paper, integration of parabolic trough and linear Fresnel collectors for an optimum design of a CSP plant is proposed. The integrated CSP plant configuration combines the advantages of conventional HTF-based PTC fields and DSG of LFR fields. Thermo-economic comparisons between PTC-based, LFR-based and integrated CSP plant configurations, without hybridization and storage, are presented in this paper. An approximate, but simple selection methodology for these configurations, based on the values of relative collector field costs per unit of energy gain and relative isentropic efficiency of turbines, is also proposed to generate selection diagram. This diagram helps in selecting optimum configuration for the CSP plant. The applicability of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through an illustrative case study. Detailed simulations are advisable in case of design point close to separation lines between different regions in the selection diagram.},

By evaluating such configurations using the concept of maximal flux concentration, based upon average radiation flux concentration over the acceptance angle, clear ray trace comparisons may be made between different collector configurations. These comparisons allow the most effective configuration to be selected for a given application. An example of a comparatively simple and practical two-stage concentrator having equal or better maximal performance than previous work for high rim angle primaries is given. This uses an unusual straight section of reflector and allows rays to cross from one reflector segment of the secondary to another. Versions which allow concentration up to 90% of maximal are described, as are versions achieving 80% with high collection efficiency. Use of the 1sin θmax geometrical concentration criterion based upon aperture ratios is suggested to be inappropriate for comparisons. },

	Abstract = {Abstract In solar power tower (SPT) systems, selecting the optimum location of thousands of heliostats and the most profitable tower height and receiver size remains a challenge. Given the complexity of the problem, breaking the optimisation process down into two consecutive steps is suggested here; first, a primary, or energy, optimisation, which is practically independent of the cost models, and then a main, or economic, optimisation. The primary optimisation seeks a heliostat layout supplying the maximum annual incident energy for all the explored combinations of receiver sizes and tower heights. The annual electric output is then calculated as the combination of the incident energy and the simplified (annual averaged) receiver thermal losses and power efficiencies. Finally, the figure of merit of the main optimisation is the levelised cost of electric energy (LCOE) where the capital cost models used for the \{LCOE\} calculation are reported by the System Advisor Model (SAM)-NREL and Sandia. This structured optimisation, splitting energy procedures from economic ones, enables the organisation of a rather complex process, and it is not limited to any particular power tower code. Moreover, as the heliostat field layout is already fully optimised before the economic optimisation, the profiles of the \{LCOE\} versus the receiver radius for the tower heights explored here are sharp enough to establish optima easily. As an example of the new procedure, we present a full thermo-economic optimisation for the design of the collector field of an actual \{SPT\} system (Gemasolar, 20 MWe, radially staggered surrounding field with 2650 heliostats, 15 h of storage). The optimum design found for Gemasolar is reasonably consistent with the scarce open data. Finally, optimum designs are strongly dependent on the receiver cost, the electricity tariff and the assumed maximum receiver surface temperature. },

	Abstract = {A high-temperature solar thermal receiver is subject to temperature-dependent emission and convection losses. Minimizing these losses is essential to realization of high temperature, high efficiency systems. Dividing the aperture into separate stages according to the irradiance distribution has been shown theoretically to significantly reduce these losses. In such a partitioned system, the working fluid is gradually heated as it passes through a sequence of receiver elements with increasing irradiance levels. An experiment to demonstrate this principle using two heating stages has been constructed at the Weizmann Institute's Solar Tower. The high-temperature receiver stage is the Directly Irradiated Annular Pressurized Receiver (DIAPR). The low-temperature stage is implemented as a partial ring of intermediate-temperature cavity tubular receivers (preheaters) surrounding the central high-temperature stage. Following initial concentration by a part of the Weizmann Institute heliostat field, the light enters the receivers via secondary concentrators constructed as approximate CPCs. We present recent test results with the two-stage system. Air exit temperatures of up to 1000$\,^{\circ}$C were obtained, with the low-temperature stage supplying up to 750$\,^{\circ}$C. The power output was up to 55 kWth. Heat transfer in the high-temperature receiver, losses due to the partitioning, and future plans for partitioned receivers are discussed. },

An effective structure using the condensed fluid of Rankine cycle to cool the Stirling engines to use the heat released by Stirling engines was proposed. The cascade system model with different fluid circuits was developed. The models of some important components of the system, such as dish collector, trough collector and Stirling engine array, are presented with detail explanation in this paper. Corresponding stand-alone systems were also developed for comparison. Simulations were conducted with the models to find out efficiency difference between cascade system and corresponding stand-alone systems. The directions to increase the efficiency difference were also considered. Results show that the cascade system can achieve a higher efficiency with a high solar irradiance (&gt;550 W/m2). The flow type of fluids between heating and cooling Stirling engine array is also required to concern on designing a cascade system with Stirling engine array. },

	Abstract = {A number of codes have been developed in order to optimize the heliostat field layout for solar power tower plants. These codes are intended to improve calculation accuracy as well as computational time. Of all the factors that need to be taken into account in these codes, shading and blocking calculations introduce significant complexity as they are computationally intensive. In this paper, a new and simple method is proposed to identify the heliostats with the greatest potential for shadowing and blocking a heliostat. Using the new method, the computational time is considerably reduced as unnecessary calculations are avoided. The Sassi method [1] is then used to calculate the shading and blocking efficiency. The results are compared with the literature and good agreement is obtained. As a case study, the paper also investigates optimization of a 50MWth heliostat field layout for Dagget, California. Yearly insolation weighted efficiency is selected as the objective function while two parameters of the prophylaxis pattern [2], which define the shape of the field layout, are the design variables. The acceptance angle of the cavity receiver and distance between the adjacent heliostats are the physical constraints which are included in the optimization. The optimization algorithm is explained in detail and the optimal field layout is presented. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	Abstract = {The aim of this work was to propose a novel system combines both solar chimney and thermo siphon solar tower systems. To this end, theoretical study to the proposed system was conducted. In this new system, the solar tower was installed at the exit of the solar chimney. The results of the theoretical study showed that, the new system generates more power compared with the conventional system. It was found that the maximum power extracted from the new system was about two times that obtained from the conventional system at the same height, for the specified range studied in this work. In addition, it was found that the new system has higher overall efficiency and generates higher speeds of air at the chimney inlet. This increase in both maximum power and air speed at the chimney inlet from the new system is enhanced with the rise in solar irradiance, radius of collector, and ratio of solar tower height to solar chimney height. Moreover, the results indicated that there is a certain ratio between solar tower length and width at which the maximum extracted mechanical power reached a maximum value for the specified parameters of solar irradiance, collector radius, height of chimney, and height of solar tower.

	Abstract = {Abstract Simulations were carried out to predict the performance of a Solar Rankine Cycle (SRC) and an Integrated Solar Combined Cycle (ISCC) when combined with two different solar field configurations based on parabolic trough and power tower systems. For the selected cases, yearly plant performance was computed under real operating conditions on a one hour basis. A computing procedure was developed by integrating two commercial softwares with in-house computer code. Thermodynamic performance was featured for every plant configuration both at nominal and part load conditions. A single reheat regenerative Rankine cycle was chosen for the \{SRC\} plant whereas a commercial gas turbine, i.e. Siemens SGT-800, with a dual pressure heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) was assumed for the \{ISCC\} plant. As far as the heat transfer fluid (HTF) is concerned, molten salt was chosen to transfer heat to the water loop in the SRC. Synthetic oil was considered in the \{ISCC\} plant. Plants were assumed to be located in a Southern Spain site. The comparative analysis was mainly focused on the influence of \{CSP\} technology on global solar energy conversion efficiency of both \{SRC\} and \{ISCC\} plants. Special attention was devoted to assess trough collectors (PTCs) against the solar tower (ST) system in terms of intercepted radiation and thermal power sent to the power block. The \{ISCC\} coupled with a \{ST\} was found to assure the highest annual solar-to-electric efficiency of 21.8%. This is the result of both higher collection efficiency of \{ST\} compared to \{PTCs\} and higher conversion efficiency of solar energy introduced into the combined cycle, as compared to SRC. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Heat loss is an important factor in predicting the performance of solar receiver of concentrated solar power (CSP) systems. This study presents a numerical simulation calculating convection and radiation heat losses from four different receiver shapes including external and cavity type receivers with different opening ratios (ratio of cavity aperture area to receiver area). The simulation was carried out using Fluent \{CFD\} (computational fluid dynamics) software considering three different receiver temperatures (600, 750, and 900 $\,^{\circ}$C), three wind velocities (1, 5, and 10 m/s), and two wind directions (head-on and side-on). The simulation results were then used for deriving a simplified correlation model which gives the fraction of convection heat loss by a function of opening ratio, receiver temperature, and wind velocity. The calculated fraction can be easily converted to convection heat loss, total heat loss, or receiver efficiency once the radiation heat loss is estimated by any applicable prediction model. Calculated heat loses by the proposed simple correlation model showed good agreements with the simulation results with 11.4% and 5.9% average absolute deviations for convection heat loss and total heat loss, respectively. Validation of the model with experimental data was also carried out using test results available from three central receiver systems (Martin Marietta, Solar One and Solar Two). },

The dimensionless factor of indicated power losses provides a new viewpoint for engine analysis and design. In support of the method, experimental GPU-3 test results have been reanalysed, proving the accuracy of maximum indicated power predictions and providing values of the dimensionless factor of indicated power losses. Scaling factors corresponding to strict dynamic similarity are supplied for several typical cases. Similarity relaxation criteria are also recommended to be used when strict dynamic similarity leads to inadequate specifications for the derivative. Some numerical examples illustrate the method. },

	Abstract = {A technique for calculating the efficiency and power of Stirling machines is presented. This technique is based on the First Law of Thermodynamics for processes with finite speed and the Direct Method for closed systems. In order to apply the Direct Method to Stirling Cycles, a new and novel PV/Px diagram is presented that shows the effects of pressure losses due to friction, finite speed and throttling processes in the regenerator of the Stirling engine. The method used for the analysis of this irreversible cycle with finite speed involves the direct integration of equations based on the first law for processes with finite speed to obtain the cycle efficiency and power directly. This technique is termed the Direct Method. The results predicted by this analysis are in good agreement with the actual engine performance data of 12 different Stirling engines, over a range of output from economy to maximum power. This provides a solid verification that this analysis, based on the Direct Method, can accurately predict actual Stirling engine performance, particularly with regard to efficiency and output power. In addition to the powerful predictive capabilities of the Direct Method, the new PV/Px diagram for the Stirling cycle is both an effective and an intuitive tool for explaining the operation and design of Stirling machines.

An empircical model of mechanical power losses is proposed to complete the indicated power model previously introduced by Prieto and co-workers. That approach is mainly based on the characteristic Stirling number and allows the performance of known prototypes to be analysed from the viewpoint of indicated power, brake power and mechanical efficiency. After showing that similarity criteria can be extended to brake power performance, scaling factors have been derived for typical scaling cases. Some examples show that quasi-static simulation and scaling techniques may be combined to support preliminary design procedures. },

The system uses a cavity receiver containing 20 reactor tubes filled with iron based catalyst material, which collects the radiation from a 20 m2 dish solar concentrator. Reliable operation over a range of conditions including cloud transients has been demonstrated. Parallel theoretical investigations have established that maximising the potential for electrical power production from ammonia synthesis reactors, can largely be achieved through appropriate choice of average operating temperature in standard reactors. The possibility of operating the ammonia based system using trough concentrators has also been investigated theoretically, and the preliminary results indicate encouraging energy storage efficiencies in the region of 53\%. },

	Abstract = {One of the most novel applications of the Stirling cycle is in the free piston configuration that was initially designed by W. Beale. In free piston Stirling engines (FPSEs), there are no mechanical linkages coupling the pistons or displacers, the motions of the reciprocating components follow the working gas pressure variations. Fillipo de Monte and G. Benvenuto have recently proposed a linearization technique of the dynamic balance equations. The aim of this paper is to predict the thermodynamic conditions for stable operation of \{FPSEs\} and their modeling. The equations of the angular velocity are solved analytically in terms of the working gas mass and the displacer--piston phase angle of the machine. Using the criterion of stable engine cyclic steady operation, a mathematically rigorous form is obtained for the main parameters of the engine. Furthermore, for simplicity reasons, thermodynamic magnitudes are obtained using the Schmidt analysis (isothermal model). },

	Abstract = {The performance of Stirling engines meets the demands of the efficient use of energy and environmental security and therefore they are the subject of much current interest. Hence, the development and investigation of Stirling engine have come to the attention of many scientific institutes and commercial companies. The Stirling engine is both practically and theoretically a significant device, its practical virtue is simple, reliable and safe which was recognized for a full century following its invention by Robert Stirling in 1816. The engine operates on a closed thermodynamic cycle, which is reversible. Today Stirling cycle-based systems are in commercial use as a heat pump, cryogenic refrigeration and air liquefaction. As a prime mover, Stirling cycles remain the subject of research and development efforts. The objective of this paper is to provide fundamental information and present a detailed review of the past efforts taken for the development of the Stirling cycle engine and techniques used for engine analysis. A number of attempts have been made by researches to build and improve the performance of Stirling engines. It is seen that for successful operation of engine system with good efficiency a careful design of heat exchangers, proper selection of drive mechanism and engine configuration is essential. The study indicates that a Stirling cycle engine working with relatively low temperature with air of helium as working fluid is potentially attractive engines of the future, especially solar-powered low-temperature differential Stirling engines with vertical, double acting, and gamma configuration. },

	Abstract = {A model of an irreversible cycle of the Stirling heat engine, using air as the working substance, has been established. Several irreversibilities due to the non-adiabatic regenerator dead volumes of hot space, cold space, and regenerator that the regenerator effective temperature is an arithmetic mean of the heater and cooler temperature. In addition, the general irreversibilities of the non-quasistatic cycle are taken into account. Numerical simulation is performed and the effects of the regenerator effectiveness and dead volumes are studied. Some fundamental optimal relations and general performance characteristic curves of the cycle are obtained. The results from this study indicate that the engine net work is affected by the cycle irreversibilities, while the heat input and engine efficiency are affected by both the regenerator effectiveness and dead volumes. It is concluded that the system operating temperature and the overall system efficiency depend on the internal irreversibility of the heat engine. PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	Abstract = {The Stirling cycle engine is gaining increasing attention in the current energy market as a clean, quiet and versatile prime mover for use in such situations as solar thermal generation, micro-cogeneration and other micro-distributed generation situations. A theoretical Stirling cycle engine model is developed. Using a theoretical decoupled engine configuration in which working space swept volume, volume variation, phase angle and dead space ratio are controlled via a black-box electronic controller, a model is developed that is to be used as a tool for analysis of the ideal Stirling cycle engine and the limits on its real-world realisation. The theoretical configuration approximates the five-space configuration common in Stirling cycle analysis. It comprises two working spaces and three heat exchangers: hot side, cold side and the regenerator between. The kinematic crank mechanism is replaced by electronically controlled motor/generator units, with one motor/generator controlling each of the working pistons. The use of stop valves permits the flow and non-flow processes inherent in the ideal cycle to be realised. The engine configuration considered here is not intended as a viable prime mover but rather a tool for study of the limitations of the cycle. },

	Abstract = {The study of free piston Stirling engine (FPSE) requires both accurate thermodynamic and dynamic modelling to predict its performances. The steady state behaviour of the engine partly relies on non linear dissipative phenomena such as pressure drop loss within heat exchangers which is dependant on the temperature within the associated components. An analytical thermodynamic model which encompasses the effectiveness and the flaws of the heat exchangers and the regenerator has been previously developed and validated. A semi-analytical dynamic model of \{FPSE\} is developed and presented in this paper. The thermodynamic model is used to define the thermal variables that are used in the dynamic model which evaluates the kinematic results. Thus, a coupled iterative strategy has been used to perform a global simulation. The global modelling approach has been validated using the experimental data available from the \{NASA\} RE-1000 Stirling engine prototype. The resulting coupled thermodynamic--dynamic model using a standardized description of the engine allows efficient and realistic preliminary design of FPSE. },

	Abstract = {A mathematical model for the overall thermal efficiency of the solar-powered high temperature differential dish-Stirling engine with finite-rate heat transfer, regenerative heat losses, conductive thermal bridging losses and finite regeneration processes time is developed. The model takes into consideration the effect of the absorber temperature and the concentrating ratio on the thermal efficiency; radiation and convection heat transfer between the absorber and the working fluid as well as convection heat transfer between the heat sink and the working fluid. The results show that the optimized absorber temperature and concentrating ratio are at about 1100 K and 1300, respectively. The thermal efficiency at optimized condition is about 34\%, which is not far away from the corresponding Carnot efficiency at about 50\%. Hence, the present analysis provides a new theoretical guidance for designing dish collectors and operating the Stirling heat engine system. },

	Abstract = {This paper provides a theoretical investigation on the thermodynamic analysis of a Stirling engine with linear and sinusoidal variations of the volume. The regenerator in a Stirling engine is an internal heat exchanger allowing to reach high efficiency. We used an isothermal model to analyse the net work and the heat stored in the regenerator during a complete cycle. We show that the engine efficiency with perfect regeneration doesn't depend on the regenerator dead volume but this dead volume strongly amplifies the imperfect regeneration effect. An analytical expression to estimate the improvement due to the regenerator has been proposed including the combined effects of dead volume and imperfect regeneration. This could be used at the very preliminary stage of the engine design process. },

	Abstract = {Abstract A solar-powered high temperature differential Stirling engine was considered for optimization using multiple criteria. A thermal model was developed so that the output power and thermal efficiency of the solar Stirling system with finite rate of heat transfer, regenerative heat loss, conductive thermal bridging loss, finite regeneration process time and imperfect performance of the dish collector could be obtained. The output power and overall thermal efficiency were considered for simultaneous maximization. Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) based on the NSGA-II algorithm were employed while the solar absorber temperature and the highest and lowest temperatures of the working fluid were considered the decision variables. The Pareto optimal frontier was obtained and a final optimal solution was also selected using various decision-making methods including the fuzzy Bellman--Zadeh, \{LINMAP\} and TOPSIS. It was found that multi-objective optimization could yield results with a relatively low deviation from the ideal solution in comparison to the conventional single objective approach. Furthermore, it was shown that, if the weight of thermal efficiency as one of the objective functions is considered to be greater than weight of the power objective, lower absorber temperature and low temperature ratio should be considered in the design of the Stirling engine. },

	Abstract = {The main objective of the present work is to develop a general-purpose numerical method for improving design/simulation tools for the concentrating solar collectors (CSCs) of concentrated solar power (CSP) systems. A new modelling method and homemade unified code with the Monte Carlo Ray-Trace (MCRT) method for the \{CSCs\} are presented firstly. The details of the new designing method and homemade unified code with \{MCRT\} for numerical investigations on solar concentrating and collecting characteristics of the \{CSCs\} are introduced. Three coordinate systems are used in the \{MCRT\} program and can be totally independent from each other. Solar radiation in participating medium and/or non-participating medium can be taken into account simultaneously or dividedly in the simulation. The criteria of data processing and method/code checking are also proposed in detail. Finally the proposed method and code are applied to simulate and analyze the involuted photo-thermal conversion processes in three typical CSCs. The results show that the proposed method and model are reliable to simulate various types of CSCs. },

In this design method, a heat transfer model of the absorber wall is used for analyzing the main heat transfer process between the cavity wall outer surface, the inner surface and the working fluid. Furthermore, a ray-tracing model based on the parameters of a real dish is utilized for obtaining the solar radiative boundary conditions for the heat transfer model. Impinging jet cooling technology is introduced due to its high heat transfer coefficient in the stagnation area, which can be used for cooling the peak flux on the cavity wall. After applying a well-designed impinging system, the temperature peak on the peak flux region in traditional receiver designs can be mitigated without introducing any over pressure drop problem. },

In this study a solar receiver meeting the specific requirements for integration into a small-scale (10 kWel) dish-mounted hybrid solar micro gas-turbine system has been designed with a special focus on the trade-offs between efficiency, pressure drop, material utilization and economic design. A situation analysis, performed using a multi-objective optimizer, has shown that a pressurized configuration, where the solar receiver is placed before the turbine, is superior to an atmospheric configuration with the solar receiver placed after the turbine. Based on these initial design results, coupled CFD/FEM simulations have been performed, allowing detailed analysis of the designs under the expected operating conditions. The results show that the use of volumetric solar receivers to provide heat input to micro gas-turbine based solar dish systems appears to be a promising solution; with material temperatures and material stresses well below permissible limits. },

@article{Araoz2015,
	Abstract = {Abstract The Stirling engine is a closed-cycle regenerative system that presents good theoretical properties. These include a high thermodynamic efficiency, low emissions levels thanks to a controlled external heat source, and multi-fuel capability among others. However, the performance of actual prototypes largely differs from the mentioned theoretical potential. Actual engine prototypes present low electrical power outputs and high energy losses. These are mainly attributed to the complex interaction between the different components of the engine, and the challenging heat transfer and fluid dynamics requirements. Furthermore, the integration of the engine into decentralized energy systems such as the Combined Heat and Power systems (CHP) entails additional complications. These has increased the need for engineering tools that could assess design improvements, considering a broader range of parameters that would influence the engine performance when integrated within overall systems. Following this trend, the current work aimed to implement an analysis that could integrate the thermodynamics, and the thermal and mechanical interactions that influence the performance of kinematic Stirling engines. In particular for their use in Combined Heat and Power systems. The mentioned analysis was applied for the study of an engine prototype that presented very low experimental performance. The numerical methodology was selected for the identification of possible causes that limited the performance. This analysis is based on a second order Stirling engine model that was previously developed and validated. The simulation allowed to evaluate the effect that different design and operational parameters have on the engine performance, and consequently different performance curves were obtained. These curves allowed to identify ranges for the charged pressure, temperature ratio, heat exchangers dimensions, crank phase angle and crank mechanical effectiveness, where the engine performance was improved. In addition, the curves also permitted to recognise ranges were the design parameters could drastically reduce the brake power and efficiency. The results also showed that the design of the engine is affected by the conditions imposed by the \{CHP\} interactions, and that the engine could reach a brake power closer to 832 W with a corresponding brake efficiency of 26% when the adequate design parameters were considered. On the other hand, the performance could also be very low; as the reported in experimental tests, with brake power measurements ranging 52--120 W. },

	Abstract = {Abstract A three phase free piston type double acting Stirling engine model is proposed and validated using experimental results. The modeling strategy is based on a combination of two sub-models: a global thermal model of the engine to deal with heat sources coupling and a detailed equivalent electrical network model which accounts for the gas and mechanical dynamic physics of the engine. Derived features, such as the amplitude, the frequency, the compression and the expansion powers are then finally obtained. The model is experimentally validated with a prototype of a free piston Stirling engine. Mean error on the amplitude, the frequency, the internal temperatures and the compression and expansion powers is 9\%, so the model is considered accurate enough to predict performances. For optimization purpose, a numerical analysis is performed selecting the three following critical parameters: (i) dead volume of the chambers, (ii) natural frequency of the mechanical oscillators and (iii) thermal conduction between hot and cold sides. Smaller dead volume, large oscillating mass and high insulation are to be sought for maximizing the performances. With a pressurization of 3 bar, a theoretical useful power of 18 W can be reach with conservative modification of the existing prototype. Moreover, energy and exergy analyses highlight the main losses in the system: thermal leakage, gas spring hysteresis as well as heat transfer and viscous dissipation in the heat exchangers. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Thermal models for the simulation of Stirling engines need to have greater accuracy along with simple and low-cost calculation. In this regard, a new closed-form thermal model was presented for the thermal simulation of Stirling engines. The new model called \{PFST\} (polytropic-finite speed thermodynamics) was developed based on the combination of polytropic analysis of expansion/compression processes and the concept of finite speed thermodynamics (FST). Therefore, compression/expansion works of compression/expansion processes and transferred heat into the heater of Stirling engines were determined based on polytropic analysis, instead of isothermal processes of the ideal Stirling cycle. The calculated work of polytropic processes was corrected to include the effects of internal irreversibilities including pressure throttling in heat exchangers, mechanical friction, and finite motion of the pistons. Output power and thermal efficiency of Stirling engines were calculated as functions of various engine parameters. The developed \{PFST\} model was implemented on a prototype Stirling engine, called GPU-3 engine, and the obtained results were compared with those of other closed-form and numerical models as well as experimental data. It was found that the new closed-form model, in addition to its simple and low-cost calculation, had the same order of accuracy as recently developed numerical models. },

	Abstract = {Abstract In this article, an experimental investigation is carried out to examine the heat transfer characteristics of a coil type solar dish receiver under actual concentrate solar radiation conditions. During the test, the concentrated solar flux is approximately 1000 kW/m2 at aperture. The solar irradiance is almost unchanged (650 W/m2) for continuous two hours in the afternoon, which is used to analyze the energy and exergy performance of the solar receiver. Experimental results show that, the efficiency of the solar receiver is normally above 70% with the highest efficiency of 82%, whereas at steady state, the efficiency is maintained at around 80%. A very low value of the heat loss factor (0.02 kW/K) could be achieved during the current steady state operating conditions. The highest value of the exergy rate is around 8.8 kW, whereas the maximum energy rate can reach 21.3 kW. In addition, the highest exergy efficiency is approximately 28%, and the highest energy efficiency is around 82%. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Popular thermodynamic analyses including finite time thermodynamic analysis was lately developed based upon external irreversibilities while internal irreversibilities such as friction, pressure drop and entropy generation were not considered. The aforementioned disadvantage reduces the reliability of the finite time thermodynamic analysis in the design of an accurate Stirling engine model. Consequently, the finite time thermodynamic analysis could not sufficiently satisfy researchers for implementing in design and optimization issues. In this study, finite speed thermodynamic analysis was employed instead of finite time thermodynamic analysis for studying Stirling heat engine. The finite speed thermodynamic analysis approach is based on the first law of thermodynamics for a closed system with finite speed and the direct method. The effects of heat source temperature, regenerating effectiveness, volumetric ratio, piston stroke as well as rotational speed are included in the analysis. Moreover, maximum output power in optimal rotational speed was calculated while pressure losses in the Stirling engine were systematically considered. The result reveals the accuracy and the reliability of the finite speed thermodynamic method in thermodynamic analysis of Stirling heat engine. The outcomes can help researchers in the design of an appropriate and efficient Stirling engine. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) can be used as an efficient low cost energy conversion system to produce different types of energy, such as electricity, through the use of concentrated parabolic dish systems. In the study of CSP, most of the researchers focus on the heat losses and their relationships to the receivers' geometries. The present study concentrates on the optical efficiency as well as the flux distribution of the three different geometries: cylindrical, conical and spherical, of a cavity receiver, with the objective of analysing their behaviour using an advanced ray tracing method. The results of this study have shown that there is a connection between the flux distribution on the internal surfaces of the cavities and their optical efficiency. Moreover, the conical shape receiver received, as well as absorbed, a higher amount of reflected flux energy than the other shapes. The optical efficiency reached 75.3\%, 70.1\% and 71.5\% for the conical, spherical and cylindrical shapes respectively at surface absorptivity of 85\%. Also, the focal point location depends on the shape of the cavity receiver and its absorptivity. Thereby, there is an optimum distance for each design depending on these two factors. The results of the simulated work are validated using the experimental work found in the literature. },

Kinematic relations of the engine linkages were determined and Lagrange formulations were formed for rigid body dynamics. Working gas pressures on each surface of the rigid bodies were calculated over time using a third order thermodynamic analysis code. A test setup was established for measuring dynamic and thermodynamic state variables of ST500engine. First, experiment data was used to validate the thermodynamic code results. Then the dynamic formulations combined with the thermodynamic code were simultaneously solved and the result is compared to \{ST500\} dynamic response. Finally, using the whole dynamic model, new aspects of Stirling engine behavior were investigated. The dynamic--thermodynamic combination of the model gives the opportunity to instantly calculate a precise open-loop response, which is the essential part of designing proper load controllers for inherently unstable Stirling engines. },

	Abstract = {Abstract This paper presents a linearization of the dynamic equation for a free-piston engine generator (FPEG), and simplifies it to a one-degree forced vibration system with viscous damping. The analogy between a mass-spring damper and a \{FPEG\} system is expressed, and the solution to the vibration system is solved. The model was successfully validated with respect to experimental data obtained from a prototype. The simulated piston displacement during steady operation showed similar trends with the test results and the error of the displacement amplitude was controlled within 3%. The state-space equations and the transfer function of the system are obtain using the fast response numerical model. An example of model application in the real \{FEPG\} control system was provided. Compared to the previous numerical model with differential approaches, the solving time of the proposed fast response model can be significantly reduced. The simplicity and flexibility of the proposed model make it feasible to be implemented to several computing software, i . e . Matlab, AMESim, Labview, Dymola et al. It can be easily implemented to real-time Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulation model for the future piston dynamic control system development. In addition, since it reveals how an \{FPEG\} operates in a resonant principle, the model is useful for parameter selection in the \{FPEG\} design process. },

Genetic algorithm was used to get the Pareto frontier, and optimum points were obtained using the decision making methods of \{LINMAP\} and TOPSIS. The optimization results have been compared with those obtained using the ecological method. It was shown that the multi-objective optimization in this paper has a better balance among the optimizing criteria (maximum mechanical power, maximum thermal efficiency and minimum entropy generation flow). The effects of the hot source temperature and the total thermal conductance of the engine on the Pareto frontier have been also studied. This sensibility study shows that an increase in the hot reservoir temperature can increase the output mechanical power, the thermal efficiency of the engine, but also the entropy generation rate. In addition to this, an increase of the total thermal conductance of the engine can strongly increase the output mechanical power and only slightly increase the thermal efficiency. These results allow us to improve the engine performance after some modifications as geometrical dimensions (diameter, stroke, heat exchange surface, etc.) and physical parameters (temperature, thermal conductivity). },

	Abstract = {Abstract In this study, a solar dish collector is considered with a rectangular cavity receiver. The investigated parameters were included the receiver aperture area (a2), receiver tube diameter, cavity depth, inlet temperature and mass flow rate through the receiver. This cavity receiver is used as the heat source of the organic Rankine cycle (ORC). The \{ORC\} system is considered with \{R141b\} as the working fluid at the saturated condition. The main objective is the calculation of the optimum parameters for attaining the maximum overall thermal efficiency of the system. With the help of the receiver modeling techniques, the optimum aspect ratios of 54.25, 40.69, 32.56, 23.25 and 18.09 are identified for five cavity depths of 0.5a, 0.75a, 1a, 1.5a, and 2a where the accompanying optical efficiencies are 89\%, 92\%, 94\%, 96\% and 96\%, respectively. It is concluded that for increasing the collector efficiency and overall thermal efficiency, a higher mass flow rate, and a lower inlet thermal oil inlet temperature are required. Also the results show that the optimum characteristic of the cavity for achieving highest collector efficiency and the highest overall thermal efficiency includes smaller tube diameter, lower inlet temperature of the working fluid, and the cavity depth of 1a. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Stirling engine has become preferable for high attention towards the use of alternate renewable energy resources like biomass and solar energy. Stirling engine is the main component of dish Stirling system in thermal power generation sector. Stirling engine is an externally heating engine, which theoretical efficiency is as high as Carnot cycle's, but actual ones are always far below compared with the Carnot efficiency. A number of studies have been done on multi-objective optimization to improve the design of Stirling engine. In the current study, a multi-objective optimization method, which is a combination of multiple optimization algorithms including differential evolution, genetic algorithm and adaptive simulated annealing, was proposed. This method is an attempt to generalize and improve the robustness and diversity with above three kinds of population based meta-heuristic optimization techniques. The analogous interpreter was linked and interchanged to find the best global optimal solution for Stirling engine performance optimization. It decreases the chance of convergence at a local minimum by powering from the fact that these three algorithms run parallel and members from each population and technique are swapped. The optimization considers five decision variables, including engine frequency, mean effective pressure, temperature of heating source, number of wires in regenerator matrix, and the wire diameter of regenerator, as multiple objectives. The Pareto optimal frontier was obtained and a final optimal solution was also selected by using various multi-criteria decision making methods including techniques for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution and Simple Additive Weighting.

	Abstract = {Abstract A key issue in designing and optimizing Stirling engines is to build a precise thermodynamic model to predict the output power, thermal efficiency, and detailed performance properties and provide useful information for further improvement. In this study, a thermodynamic model called Improved Simple Analytical Model (ISAM) was proposed, carefully considering heat and power losses in Stirling engines. A 100 W β -type Stirling engine was built and tested with helium and nitrogen when pressure and rotary speed ranging from 1.6 \{MPa\} to 3 \{MPa\} and 260 r/min to 1380 r/min, respectively. Experimental information on performance, such as \{PV\} diagrams and temperatures of the heater and cooler, was much detailed. Increasing rotary speed brings a ``thin'' \{PV\} diagram because it made compression and expansion processes become more imperfect, indicating heat transfer enhancement was necessary for compression and expansion chamber in a high speed Stirling engine. Shaft power reached the maximum value of 30.1 W for helium and 21.0 W for nitrogen at rotary speeds of 1000 r/min and 650 r/min, respectively. Improving the mean pressure of gas increased the indicated power, cycle efficiency, shaft power, and electrical power. The maximum indicated power and cycle efficiency were 165 W and 16.5% for helium and 139 W and 12.2% for nitrogen in the same working conditions of 2.96 \{MPa\} and 1120 r/min. The \{ISAM\} agrees well with the experimental data with a deviation of 4.3--13.4% for helium and 1--7.1% for nitrogen. Analysis of energy losses with \{ISAM\} indicated that helium had larger shuttle and seal leakage losses and smaller flow resistance and regenerator heat transfer losses than nitrogen under the same working conditions. Flow resistance and regenerator heat transfer losses, which increased much more rapidly than seal leakage or shuttle heat losses with the increase in rotary speed and pressure, played an important role and resulted in different performances with the two working gases. This study provides comprehensive understanding of the influence mechanism of rotary speed, pressure and working gas in the view of heat/power losses for Stirling engine performance, and recommends that more work (e.g., mechanisms of heat and power losses and \{PV\} diagrams) should be performed to improve the precision of second-order models. },

	Abstract = {Abstract The optical performance of a solar dish concentrator/cavity receiver system based on the Monte Carlo Ray Tracing Method (MCRTM) was carried out under ideal optics. The study was precipitated by a need to analyze the influence of geometrical parameters and surface properties of a cavity receiver systematically and to understand the mechanism of the optical performance under various parameters. These include diameter ratio (the ratio of aperture diameter to absorber outer diameter), height ratio (the ratio of absorber height to absorber outer diameter) and sidewall absorptivity of cavity receiver. In addition, an optical efficiency of the absorber is defined and presented for the first time. The analysis indicates that the optical efficiency increases and then decreases with higher height ratio, while optical efficiency curves are reduced monotonically with diameter ratio. Simultaneously, the effects of the height and diameter ratios on optical efficiency are both influenced by sidewall absorptivity. Based on the results, a correlation of optical efficiency was further developed to quantify the influences of these factors. The maximum optical efficiency and its corresponding optimal height ratio from both simulation and correlation are presented and obtain reasonable agreement. The optimized selection of height ratio along with diameter ratio are suggested using this result. The height ratio is found to be a pure controlling parameter of the radiation flux distribution. },

This paper addresses the modelling and simulation of a solar powered Stirling engine system with parabolic dish and electric generator aiming to determine its energy production and efficiency. The model includes the solar radiation concentration system, the heat transfer in the thermal receiver, the thermal cycle and the mechanical and electric energy conversion. The thermodynamic and energy transfer processes in the engine are modelled in detail, including all the main processes occurring in the compression, expansion and regenerator spaces. Starting from a particular configuration, an optimization of the concentration factor is also carried out and the results for both the transient and steady state regimes are presented. It was found that using a directly illuminated thermal receiver without cavity the engine efficiency is close to 23.8% corresponding to a global efficiency of 10.4%. The components to be optimized are identified in order to increase the global efficiency of the system and the trade-off between system complexity and efficiency is discussed. },

	Abstract = {Solar Parabolic Trough Collectors (PTCs) are currently used for the production of electricity and applications with relatively higher temperatures. A heat transfer fluid circulates through a metal tube (receiver) with an external selective surface that absorbs solar radiation reflected from the mirror surfaces of the PTC. In order to reduce the heat losses, the receiver is covered by an envelope and the enclosure is usually kept under vacuum pressure. The heat transfer and optical analysis of the \{PTC\} is essential to optimize and understand its performance under different operating conditions. In this paper a detailed one dimensional numerical heat transfer analysis of a \{PTC\} is performed. The receiver and envelope were divided into several segments and mass and energy balance were applied in each segment. Improvements either in the heat transfer correlations or radiative heat transfer analysis are presented as well. The partial differential equations were discretized and the nonlinear algebraic equations were solved simultaneously. Finally, to validate the numerical results, the model was compared with experimental data obtained from Sandia National Laboratory (SNL) and other one dimensional heat transfer models. Our results showed a better agreement with experimental data compared to other models. },

	Abstract = {Abstract The influences of some parameters on the performance of parabolic trough solar receiver are investigated in the present work. When the mass flow rate of working fluid, ambient temperature and solar incident angle increase, the heat losses of solar receiver decrease. The exergy losses of solar receiver increase as the inlet temperature of working fluid, wind velocity, and the inner diameter of glass cover increase. The convective heat loss of glass cover predominates in the heat losses of solar receiver based on thermal efficiency, but the exergy lost from absorber ends takes the largest proportion. The optical heat loss of solar collector is far more than the heat losses of solar receiver, especially in the larger solar incident angle. There exists an optimal mass flow rate of working fluid for exergy efficiency, and the thermal efficiency and exergy efficiency have opposite changing tendencies under some conditions. Therefore, the selection of evaluation criteria is crucial to the performance optimization of solar collector system. This study is of great significance to guide the design and optimization of parabolic trough receivers. },

The exergy analysis is based on a previous heat transfer model published by the authors. The main parameters considered for the analysis are: inlet temperature and mass flow rate of heat transfer fluid, wind speed, pressure or vacuum in annulus and solar irradiance. The results showed that inlet temperature of heat transfer fluid, solar irradiance, and vacuum in annulus have a significant effect on the thermal and exergetic performance, but the effect of wind speed and mass flow rate of heat transfer fluid is negligible. It was obtained that inlet temperature of heat transfer fluid cannot be optimized to achieve simultaneously maximum thermal and exergetic efficiency because they exhibit opposite trends. Finally, it was found that the highest exergy destruction is due to the heat transfer between the sun and the absorber while for exergy losses is due to optical error. },

To overcome the shortcoming of single-parameter optimization, a multi-parameter optimization of parabolic trough solar receiver is employed based on genetic algorithm in the present work. When the thermal efficiency is taken as the objective function, the heat obtained by working fluid increases while the average temperature of working fluid and wall temperatures of solar receiver decrease. The average temperature of working fluid and the wall temperatures of solar receiver increase while the heat obtained by working fluid decreases generally by taking the exergy efficiency as an objective function. Assuming that the solar radiation intensity remains constant, the exergy obtained by working fluid increases by taking exergy efficiency as the objective function, which comes at the expense of heat losses of solar receiver. },

The operating performance and optical efficiency of the parabolic trough solar collectors (PTCs) are different in different regions and different seasons. To determine the optimum design and operation of the parabolic trough solar collector throughout the year, an accurate estimation of the daily performance is needed. In this study, a mathematical model for the optical efficiency of the parabolic trough solar collector was established and three typical regions of solar thermal utilization in China were selected. The performance characteristics of cosine effect, shadowing effect, end loss effect, and optical efficiency were calculated and simulated during a whole year in these three areas by using the mathematical model. The simulation results show that the optical efficiency of PTCs changes from 0.4 to 0.8 in a whole year. The highest optical efficiency of PTCs is in June and the lowest is in December. The optical efficiency of PTCs is mainly influenced by the solar incidence angle. The model is validated by comparing the test results in parabolic trough power plant, with relative error range of 1% to about 5%.},

The power is produced using either a steam Rankine cycle (SRC) or a combined cycle, in which the \{SRC\} is the topping cycle and an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is the bottoming cycle. Seven refrigerants for the \{ORC\} were examined: R134a, R152a, R290, R407c, R600, R600a, and ammonia. Key exergetic parameters were examined: exergetic efficiency, exergy destruction rate, fuel depletion ratio, irreversibility ratio, and improvement potential. For all the cases considered it was revealed that as the solar irradiation increases, the exergetic efficiency increases. Among the combined cycles examined, the \{R134a\} combined cycle demonstrates the best exergetic performance with a maximum exergetic efficiency of 26% followed by the \{R152a\} combined cycle with an exergetic efficiency of 25%. Alternatively, the \{R600a\} combined cycle has the lowest exergetic efficiency, 20-21%. This study reveals that the main source of exergy destruction is the solar collector where more than 50% of inlet exergy is destructed, or in other words more than 70% of the total destructed exergy. In addition, more than 13% of the inlet exergy is destructed in the evaporator which is equivalent to around 19% of the destructed exergy. Finally, this study reveals that there is an exergetic improvement potential of 75% in the systems considered. },

The thermal performance of such devices is of major interest for optimising the solar field output and increase the efficiency of power plants. In this paper, a detailed numerical heat transfer model based on the finite volume method for these equipment is presented. In the model, the different elements of the receiver are discretised into several segments in both axial and azimuthal directions and energy balances are applied for each control volume. An optical model is also developed for calculating the non-uniform solar flux distribution around the receiver. This model is based on finite volume method and ray trace techniques and takes into account the finite size of the Sun. The solar heat flux is determined as a pre-processing task and coupled to the energy balance model as a boundary condition for the outer surface of the receiver. The set of algebraic equations are solved simultaneously using direct solvers. The model is thoroughly validated with results from the literature. First, the optical model is compared with known analytical solutions. After that, the performance of the overall model is tested against experimental measurements from Sandia National Laboratories and other un-irradiated receivers experiments. In all cases, results obtained shown a good agreement with experimental and analytical results. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Recently, with decreasing oil resources and environmental issues associated to use of fossil fuels, solar thermal power plants have attracted much attention among researches mainly due to zero emission and huge fuel savings they bring about. In this study, a small scale parabolic Trough collector and a thermal storage tank along with an auxiliary heater are coupled to a Kalina cycle to study the performance of the system throughout the year, both thermodynamically and economically. To examine the effect of solar collectors in the system, the model is compared to a fuel driven Kalina cycle. Results show that in 5 months of the year, the solar fraction is more than 50%. The exergy analysis reveals that the main source of destructions are solar collectors (more than 50% of total) and vapor generator. The solar collectors and vapor generator have an improvement potential of 69% and 65%, respectively. The Kalina cycle is responsible for a minor portion of total exergy destruction, thus more investment should be put on solar collectors. Economic analysis shows that, under design conditions, solar Kalina cycle has a levelized cost of electricity of 0.4274 $/kW h which is higher compared to that of fuel driven cycle with 0.3113 $/kW h. On the other hand, the solar system has a yearly fuel saving of almost 40,000 kg/year (natural gas) which is half of fuel driven cycle and can save more than 100 tons of carbon dioxide. Also, solar fraction and daily mean sun to electricity exergy efficiency of 67.71% and 5.24% are obtained, respectively, for July. Also, the thermal storage tank has a vital role on maintaining the stable working condition of Kalina cycle. To find the effect of key parameters on the performance and economic of solar system, a parametric study has been done. The results show that ammonia mass fraction variation has the most effect on exergy efficiency, solar fraction and levelized cost of electricity. This paper provides the reader to examine the performance of a small scale solar plant from exergetic view point and to estimate the overall costs associated to the system. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Direct steam generation is a potential approach to further reduce the levelized electricity cost of solar trough. Dynamic modeling of the collector loop is essential for operation and control of direct steam generation solar trough. However, the dynamic behavior of fluid based on direct steam generation is complex because of the two-phase flow in the pipeline. In this work, a nonlinear distribution parameter model has been developed to model the dynamic behaviors of direct steam generation parabolic trough collector loops under either full or partial solar irradiance disturbance. Compared with available dynamic model, the proposed model possesses two advantages: (1) real-time local values of heat transfer coefficient and friction resistance coefficient, and (2) considering of the complete loop of collectors, including subcooled water region, two-phase flow region and superheated steam region. The proposed model has shown superior performance, particularly in case of sensitivity study of fluid parameters when the pipe is partially shaded. The proposed model has been validated using experimental data from Solar Thermal Energy Laboratory of University of New South Wales, with an outlet fluid temperature relative error of only 1.91%. The validation results show that: (1) The proposed model successfully outperforms two reference models in predicting the behavior of direct steam generation solar trough. (2) The model theoretically predicts that, during solar irradiance disturbance, the discontinuities of fluid physical property parameters and the moving back and forth of two-phase flow ending location are the reasons that result in the high-frequency chattering of outlet fluid flow. (3) The model validates that the solar irradiance disturbance at subcooled water region would generates larger fluctuation of fluid parameters than two-phase flow region or superheated steam region. },

	Abstract = {Abstract A tubular cavity-receiver that uses air as the heat transfer fluid is evaluated numerically using a validated heat transfer model. The receiver is designed for use on a large-span (9 m net concentrator aperture width) solar parabolic trough concentrator. Through the combination of a parabolic primary concentrator with a nonimaging secondary concentrator, the collector reaches a solar concentration ratio of 97.5. Four different receiver configurations are considered, with smooth or V-corrugated absorber tube and single- or double-glazed aperture window. The collector's performance is characterized by its optical efficiency and heat loss. The optical efficiency is determined with the Monte Carlo ray-tracing method. Radiative heat exchange inside the receiver is calculated with the net radiation method. The 2D steady-state energy equation, which couples conductive, convective, and radiative heat transfer, is solved for the solid domains of the receiver cross-section, using finite-volume techniques. Simulations for Sevilla/Spain at the summer solstice at solar noon (direct normal solar irradiance: 847 W$\cdot$m$^{-2}$, solar incidence angle: 13.9$^\circ$) yield collector efficiencies between 60\% and 65\% at a heat transfer fluid temperature of 125$^\circ{}C$ and between 37\% and 42\% at 500$^\circ{}C$, depending on the receiver configuration. The optical losses amount to more than 30\% of the incident solar radiation and constitute the largest source of energy loss. For a 200 m long collector module operated between 300 and 500$^\circ{}C$, the isentropic pumping power required to pump the \{HTF\} through the receiver is between 11 and 17 kW. },

	Abstract = {Abstract An entirely novel solar receiver design for solar trough concentrators is proposed using air as heat transfer fluid at operating temperatures exceeding 600 $^\circ$C. It consists of an array of helically coiled absorber tubes contained side-by-side within an insulated groove having a rectangular windowed opening. Secondary concentrating optics are incorporated to boost the geometric concentration ratio to 97x. The multiple absorber tubes are connected via two axial pipes serving as feeding and collecting manifolds. The steady-state energy conservation equation coupling radiation, convection, and conduction is formulated and solved numerically using the finite volume technique. The solar flux distribution incident at each absorber tube is determined by Monte Carlo ray-tracing using spectrally and directionally dependent optical properties. Thermal radiative heat exchange is analyzed using the gray-band approximated radiosity method for an enclosure with a selective window. Model validation is accomplished by comparison to on-sun experiments with a 1 m-long solar receiver prototype composed of 7 absorber tubes, mounted on a 4.85 m-aperture solar trough concentrator. Feeding rates in the range of 5-20 ln/min to each absorber tube led to air outlet temperatures of 621-449 $^\circ$C and a peak receiver efficiency of 64%. },

From this point of view, artificial neural network (ANN) models are desired options to determine techno-economic performances of this kind of plants. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the feed-forward back-propagation learning algorithm with three different variants; Levenberge Marguardt (LM), Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG), and Pola-Ribiere Conjugate Gradient (CGP), used in the \{ANN\} to find the best approach for prediction and techno-economic optimization of parabolic trough solar thermal power plant (PTSTPP) integrated with fuel backup system and thermal energy storage. The obtained statistical parameters showed that \{LM\} algorithm with 38 neurons in a single hidden layer looks as the best \{ANN\} model to predict the annual power generation ( \{PG\} net ) and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of the presented PTSTPP. Moreover, the obtained weights from this topology were used in the \{LCOE\} analysis for determining the optimum system design. It is therefore available to get a minimum \{LCOE\} of 8.88 Cent/kWh from the new optimized plant when the plant characteristics are; 34$^\circ$C and 850 W/m2 for both design ambient temperature and solar radiation, 23 m for row spacing, 1.7 for solar multiple, and 2.5 h number of hours for the storage system. },

	Abstract = {Abstract This study investigates numerically, in terms of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), a Parabolic Trough Collector (PTC) system with nanofluid as the Heat Transfer Fluid (HTF). All the heat transfer mechanisms were taken into account to simulate the \{SEGS\} LS2-module PTC. The validation process showed very good agreement between the numerical results and the available test results from four typical testing conditions, with the use of Syltherm 800 liquid oil. Specifically, the maximum relative error observed for outlet temperature was 0.3% and 7.3% for the collector efficiency. In order to address the nanofluid modeling problem the two-phase approach was preferred (against single-phase) and validated against experimental and numerical results for a circular tube under constant wall temperature. Overall, a total of 20 different simulation cases were performed for the \{LS2\} module, for a range of nanoparticle (Al2O3) concentrations (0%-4%), thus making it possible for a parametric evaluation on the \{LS2\} efficiency. In addition, the temperature and velocity fields of the Syltherm 800/Al2O3 nanofluid were associated with the enhanced heat transfer occurring at higher nanoparticle concentrations. A boost up to 10% on the collector efficiency was reported for Al2O3 concentration of 4%, which is in accordance with relevant studies. },

With the 1.8 m2 mirror PV/T system, the characteristic parameters of the space solar cell under non-concentrating solar radiation and concentrating solar radiation are respectively tested experimentally, and the solar cell output characteristics at different opening widths of concentrating mirror of the PV/T stage under condensation are also tested experimentally. When the mirror opening width was 57 cm, the solar cell efficiency reached maximum value of 5.21%. The experimental platform of the two-stage photovoltaic thermal system was established, with a 1.8 m2 mirror PV/T stage and a 15 m2 mirror heating stage, or a 1.8 m2 mirror PV/T stage and a 30 m2 mirror heating stage. The results showed that with single cycle, the long metal cavity heating stage would bring lower thermal efficiency, but temperature rise of the working medium is higher, up to 12.06 C with only single cycle. With 30 min closed multiple cycles, the temperature of the working medium in the water tank was 62.8 $^\circ$C, with an increase of 28.7 $^\circ$C, and thermal energy with higher temperature could be output. },

	Abstract = {In this study, performance assessment of a novel system based on parabolic trough solar collectors and an organic Rankine cycle for combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) is presented. In this system, a portion of the waste heat is used for heating through a heat exchanger and the other portion is used for cooling through a single-effect absorption chiller. This study considers three modes of operation: a solar mode, which is characterized by a low-solar radiation; a solar and storage mode, which is characterized by a high-solar radiation; and a storage mode, which is the operation of the system at night time through a thermal storage tank subsystem. To assess the performance improvement of the present system, three further cases are considered: electrical power, cooling-cogeneration, and heating-cogeneration. This system is designed to produce 500 kW of electricity. Different output parameters-efficiency, net electrical power, and electrical to heating and cooling ratios-are examined in this study. This study reveals that the maximum electrical efficiency for the solar mode is 15%, for the solar and storage mode is 7%, and for the storage mode is 6.5%. Alternatively, when \{CCHP\} is used, the efficiency increases significantly. The maximum \{CCHP\} efficiency for the solar mode is 94%, for the solar and storage mode is 47%, and for the storage mode is 42%. Furthermore, this study shows that the electrical to cooling ratio is sensitive to the change in the \{ORC\} pump inlet temperature. Therefore, the variation in this temperature could be used as a good control for the amount of the cooling power needed. },

It is indicated through the analyses that this compensation method is very applicable for regions with the latitude over 25$^\circ$ (especially over 30$^\circ$) and short trough collectors. In order to verify the feasibility of the compensation method, a five-meter PTC-HNSA experimental system was built. The increased thermal efficiency of the experimental system is measured, and the result that the experimental value (increased thermal efficiency) substantially agreed with the theoretical value (increased optical efficiency) is gained. All these works can offer some valuable references to the further study on high-efficiency trough solar concentrating systems. },

	Abstract = {Abstract The solar receiver plays a key role in the performance of a solar dish electric generator. Its radiation flux distribution can directly affect the efficiency of the parabolic solar concentrator system. In this paper, radiation flux distribution of the receiver is simulated successfully using \{MCRT\} method. The impacts of incident solar irradiation, aspect ratio (the ratio of the receiver height to the receiver diameter), and system error on the radiation flux of the receiver are investigated. The parameters are studied in the following ranges: incident solar irradiation from 100 to 1100 W/m2, receiver aspect ratio from 0.5 to 1.5, and the system error from 0 to 10 mrad. A non-dimensional parameter Θ is defined to represent the ratio of radiation flux to incident solar irradiation. The results show that the maximum of Θ is about 200 in simulation conditions. The aspect ratio and system error have a significant impact on the radiation flux. The optimal receiver aspect ratio is 1.5 at a constant incident solar irradiation, and the maximum of radiation flux increases with decreasing system error, however, the radiation flux distribution can benefit from a large system error.

	Abstract = {Abstract An experimental setup to investigate the thermal performance of a cylindrical cavity receiver for an SK-14 parabolic dish concentrator is presented in this technical note. The thermal performance is evaluated using energy and exergy analyses. The receiver exergy rates and efficiencies are found to be appreciably smaller than the receiver energy rates and efficiencies. The exergy factor parameter is also proposed for quantifying the thermal performance. The exergy factor is found to be high under conditions of high solar radiation and under high operating temperatures. The heat loss factor of the receiver is determined to be around 4.6 W/K. An optical efficiency of around 52% for parabolic dish system is determined under high solar radiation conditions. This experimental setup can be used as teaching tool for people with little or no knowledge about solar dish concentrators due its simplicity and the basic mathematical formulations applied. Different types of receivers and different types of deep focal region parabolic dishes can also be tested with the experimental setup. },

	Abstract = {Abstract In this article, total heat losses from three configurations of modified cavity receiver of solar parabolic dish are investigated using 3-D numerical model. The effects of various parameters such as diameter ratio (d/D), angle of inclination (θ), operating temperature (T), insulation thickness (t) and emissivity (ε) of the cavity cover on the heat losses from the modified cavity receiver are investigated. The variable boundary conditions are considered for modified cavity receiver to produce sub-cooled hot water, saturated steam and superheated steam. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is developed to predict the heat loss for a large set of influencing parameters. Based on \{ANN\} modelling, improved Nusselt number correlations are proposed for convective, radiative and total heat losses from the modified cavity receiver. The convective heat losses are greatly influenced by receiver inclination whereas the radiation heat losses are influenced by the cavity cover emissivity. The diameter ratio also plays a major role in heat losses from the cavity receiver. The total heat loss is estimated as 522 W for superheat steam condition for θ = 0 and d/D = 0.05; whereas it is 288 W for diameter ratio 1. The total heat loss varies 25\% for inclinations 0 and 90$\,^{\circ}$. For saturated and sub-cooled steam conditions, the total heat loss variation is found to be 28\% and 21\% respectively from 0 to 90$\,^{\circ}$ inclinations for diameter ratio of 0.05. The present method predicts the heat losses more accurately compared with the existing models. },

The temperature of the absorber, the solar energy absorbed by the receiver, the mean concentration ratio and both energy and exergy efficiency of the system were obtained experimentally. In order to validate the experimental results of the \{SHE\} and to determine the \{SPC\} efficiency using the disk, an analytical study based on thermodynamics analysis is carried out. We note that a good agreement between the four experimental methods has been obtained with the four receivers used in this work. The thermal energy efficiency varies from 40\% to 77\%, the concentrating system reaches an average exergy efficiency of 50\% and a concentration factor around 178. },

We present a procedure to design a square facet concentrator for laboratory-scale research on medium-temperature thermal processes.

Large concentrating dishes generally have a reflecting surface made up of a number of individual mirror panels (facets). Optical ray tracing is used to generate a system performance model. A square facet parabolic solar concentrator with realistic specularly surface and facet positioning accuracy will deliver up to 13.604 kW of radiative power over a 250 mm radius disk (receiver diameter) located in the focal plane on the focal length of 1500mm with average concentrating ratio exceeding 1200.

	Abstract = {Abstract In this article, a 3-D numerical modeling is carried out to determine combined convection and surface radiation heat losses from a modified cavity receiver of parabolic dish collector used as mono-tube boiler for sub-cooled, saturated and superheated steam generation conditions. The forced convection heat loss from the modified cavity receiver is estimated using Nusselt number correlation developed for the modified cavity receiver. The effect of receiver inclination ( β ) , operating temperature ( T w ) , emissivity of the cavity cover ( ∊ ) , thickness of insulation ( t ins ) on the combined heat losses from the modified cavity receiver is investigated. The boundary conditions for wall temperature and insulation thicknesses are chosen to match the three steam generation conditions. It is found that the natural convection heat losses are higher at β = 0 $\,^{\circ}$ (receiver facing sideward) and lower at β = 90 $\,^{\circ}$ (receiver facing down) whereas the forced convection heat loss is higher at β = 90 $\,^{\circ}$ and lower at β = 0 $\,^{\circ}$ . The variation of radiation heat losses is marginal for all values of β and vary with T w . The effect of various parameters such as receiver inclination, wind direction ( φ ) , wind speed and diameter ratios on forced convection heat loss from the receiver has also been studied. The forced convection heat loss at lower wind speeds (&lt;2.5 m/s) is lower than the natural convection heat losses. The maximum heat losses occur at side-on wind direction ( φ = 0 ) followed by head-on wind directions ( φ = 30--90$\,^{\circ}$) and back-on wind directions ( φ = - 90 $\,^{\circ}$ to - 30 $\,^{\circ}$ ) . The heat losses vary with diameter ratios for different configurations of the receiver. The forced convection heat loss is 1.2--9 times higher than natural convection heat loss for diameter ratio (ratio of cavity diameter to aperture diameter, d/D) = 0.4 at 5 m/s and receiver inclinations varying from 0$\,^{\circ}$ to 90 $\,^{\circ}$ . Nusselt number correlations have been proposed based on the numerical analysis to estimate the combined convective and radiative heat loss. The present study attempts to estimate natural convection, forced convection and surface radiation heat losses from the modified cavity receiver under various conditions. },
